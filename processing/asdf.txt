 boy who lived mr mrs dursley number four privet drive were proud say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much they were last people youd expect be involved anything strange or mysterious because they just didnt hold with such nonsense mr dursley director firm called grunnings which made drills big beefy man with hardly any neck although did have very large mustache mrs dursley thin blonde had nearly twice usual amount neck which came very useful as she spent so much her time craning over garden fences spying on neighbors dursley s had small son called dudley their opinion there no finer boy anywhere dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had secret their greatest fear that somebody would discover they didnt think they could bear if anyone found out about potters mrs potter mrs dursleys sister but they hadnt met for several years fact mrs dursley pretended she didnt have sister because her sister her good for nothing husband were as undursleyish as possible be dursleys shuddered think what neighbors would say if potters arrived street dursleys knew that potters had small son too but they had never even seen him this boy another good reason for keeping potters away they didnt want dudley mixing with child like that when mr mrs dursley woke up on dull gray tuesday our story starts there nothing about cloudy sky outside suggest that strange mysterious things would soon be happening all over country mr dursley hummed as picked out his most boring tie for work mrs dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled screaming dudley into his high chair none them noticed large tawny owl flutter past window at half past eight mr dursley picked up his briefcase pecked mrs dursley on cheek tried kiss dudley good bye but missed because dudley now having tantrum throwing his cereal at walls little tyke chortled mr dursley as left house got into his car backed out number fours drive on corner street that noticed first sign something peculiar  cat reading map for second mr dursley didnt realize what had seen  then jerked his head around look again there tabby cat standing on corner privet drive but there wasnt map sight what could have been thinking must have been trick light mr dursley blinked stared at cat stared back as mr dursley drove around corner up road watched cat his mirror now reading sign that said privet drive  no looking at sign cats couldnt read maps or signs mr dursley gave himself little shake put cat out his mind as drove toward town thought nothing except large order drills hoping get that day but on edge town drills were driven out his mind by something else as sat usual morning traffic jam couldnt help noticing that there seemed be lot strangely dressed people about people cloaks mr dursley couldnt bear people who dressed funny clothes  getups you saw on young people supposed this some stupid new fashion drummed his fingers on steering wheel his eyes fell on huddle these weirdos standing quite close by they were whispering excitedly together mr dursley enraged see that couple them werent young at all why that man had be older than wearing an emerald green cloak nerve him but then struck mr dursley that this probably some silly stunt  these people were obviously collecting for something  yes that would be traffic moved on few minutes later mr dursley arrived grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills mr dursley always sat with his back window his office on ninth floor if hadnt might have found harder concentrate on drills that morning didnt see owls swooping past broad daylight though people down street did they pointed gazed open mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead most them had never seen an owl even at nighttime mr dursley however had perfectly normal owl free morning yelled at five different people made several important telephone calls shouted bit more very good mood until lunchtime when thought hed stretch his legs walk across road buy himself bun from bakery hed forgotten all about people cloaks until passed group them next bakers eyed them angrily as passed didnt know why but they made him uneasy this bunch were whispering excitedly too couldnt see single collecting tin on his way back past them clutching large doughnut bag that caught few words what they were saying potters thats right thats what i heard     yes their son   mr dursley stopped dead fear flooded him looked back at whisperers as if wanted say something them but thought better dashed back across road hurried up his office snapped at his secretary not disturb him seized his telephone had almost finished dialing his home number when changed his mind put receiver back down stroked his mustache thinking  no being stupid potter wasnt such an unusual name sure there were lots people called potter who had son called come think wasnt even sure his nephew called hed never even seen boy might have been harvey or harold there no point worrying mrs dursley she always got so upset at any mention her sister didnt blame her  if hed had sister like that  but all same those people cloaks  found lot harder concentrate on drills that afternoon when left building at five oclock still so worried that walked straight into someone just outside door sorry grunted as tiny old man stumbled almost fell few seconds before mr dursley realized that man wearing violet cloak didnt seem at all upset at being almost knocked ground on contrary his face split into wide smile said squeaky voice that made passersby stare dont be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today rejoice for you  know who has gone at last even muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy happy day old man hugged mr dursley around middle walked off mr dursley stood rooted spot had been hugged by complete stranger also thought had been called muggle whatever that was rattled hurried his car set off for home hoping imagining things which had never hoped before because didnt approve imagination as pulled into driveway number four first thing saw  didnt improve his mood  tabby cat hed spotted that morning now sitting on his garden wall sure same one had same markings around its eyes shoo said mr dursley loudly cat didnt move just gave him stern look this normal cat behavior mr dursley wondered trying pull himself together let himself into house still determined not mention anything his wife mrs dursley had had nice normal day she told him over dinner all about mrs next doors problems with her daughter how dudley had learned new word wont mr dursley tried act normally when dudley had been put bed went into living room time catch last report on evening news finally bird watchers everywhere have reported that nations owls have been behaving very unusually today although owls normally hunt at night are hardly ever seen daylight there have been hundreds sightings these birds flying every direction since sunrise experts are unable explain why owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern newscaster allowed himself grin most mysterious now over jim mcguffin with weather going be any more showers owls tonight jim well ted said weatherman i dont know about that but its not only owls that have been acting oddly today viewers as far apart as kent yorkshire dundee have been phoning tell me that instead rain i promised yesterday theyve had downpour shooting stars perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early  its not until next week folks but i can promise wet night tonight mr dursley sat frozen his armchair shooting stars all over britain owls flying by daylight mysterious people cloaks all over place whisper whisper about potters    mrs dursley came into living room carrying two cups tea no good hed have say something her cleared his throat nervously er  petunia dear  you havent heard from your sister lately have you as had expected mrs dursley looked shocked angry after all they normally pretended she didnt have sister no she said sharply why funny stuff on news mr dursley mumbled owls    shooting stars    there were lot funny looking people town today  so snapped mrs dursley well i just thought  maybe  something do with  you know  her crowd mrs dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips mr dursley wondered whether dared tell her hed heard name potter decided didnt dare instead said as casually as could their son  hed be about dudleys age now wouldnt i suppose so said mrs dursley stiffly whats his name again howard isnt nasty common name if you ask me oh yes said mr dursley his heart sinking horribly yes i quite agree didnt say another word on subject as they went upstairs bed while mrs dursley bathroom mr dursley crept bedroom window peered down into front garden cat still there staring down privet drive as though were waiting for something imagining things could all this have anything do with potters if did  if got out that they were related pair  well didnt think could bear dursleys got into bed mrs dursley fell asleep quickly but mr dursley lay awake turning all over his mind his last comforting thought before fell asleep that even if potters were involved there no reason for them come near him mrs dursley potters knew very well what petunia thought about them their kind  couldnt see how petunia could get mixed up anything that might be going on  yawned turned over  couldnt affect them  how very wrong mr dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but cat on wall outside showing no sign sleepiness sitting as still as statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on far corner privet drive didnt so much as quiver when car door slammed on next street nor when two owls swooped overhead fact nearly midnight before cat moved at all man appeared on corner cat had been watching appeared so suddenly silently youd have thought hed just popped out ground cats tail twitched its eyes narrowed nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive tall thin very old judging by silver his hair beard which were both long enough tuck into his belt wearing long robes purple cloak that swept ground high heeled buckled boots his blue eyes were light bright sparkling behind half moon spectacles his nose very long crooked as though had been broken at least twice this mans name albus dumbledore albus dumbledore didnt seem realize that had just arrived street where everything from his name his boots unwelcome busy rummaging his cloak looking for something but did seem realize being watched because looked up suddenly at cat which still staring at him from other end street for some reason sight cat seemed amuse him chuckled muttered i should have known found what looking for his inside pocket seemed be silver cigarette lighter flicked open held up air clicked nearest street lamp went out with little pop clicked again  next lamp flickered into darkness twelve times clicked put outer until only lights left on whole street were two tiny pinpricks distance which were eyes cat watching him if anyone looked out their window now even beady eyed mrs dursley they wouldnt be able see anything that happening down on pavement dumbledore slipped put  outer back inside his cloak set off down street toward number four where sat down on wall next cat didnt look at but after moment spoke fancy seeing you here professor mcgonagall turned smile at tabby but had gone instead smiling at rather severe looking woman who wearing square glasses exactly shape markings cat had had around its eyes she too wearing cloak an emerald one her black hair drawn into tight bun she looked distinctly ruffled how did you know me she asked my dear professor ive never seen cat sit so stiffly youd be stiff if youd been sitting on brick wall all day said professor mcgonagall all day when you could have been celebrating i must have passed dozen feasts parties on my way here professor mcgonagall sniffed angrily oh yes everyones celebrating all right she said impatiently youd think theyd be bit more careful but no  even muggles have noticed somethings going on on their news she jerked her head back at dursleys dark living room window i heard flocks owls  shooting stars  well theyre not completely stupid they were bound notice something shooting stars down kent  ill bet that dedalus diggle never had much sense you cant blame them said dumbledore gently weve had precious little celebrate for eleven years i know that said professor mcgonagall irritably but thats no reason lose our heads people are being downright careless out on streets broad daylight not even dressed muggle clothes swapping rumors she threw sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here as though hoping going tell her something but didnt so she went on fine thing would be if on very day you know who seems have disappeared at last muggles found out about us all i suppose really has gone dumbledore certainly seems so said dumbledore we have much be thankful for would you care for lemon drop what lemon drop theyre kind muggle sweet im rather fond no thank you said professor mcgonagall coldly as though she didnt think this moment for lemon drops as i say even if you know who has gone   my dear professor surely sensible person like yourself can call him by his name all this you  know who nonsense  for eleven years i have been trying persuade people call him by his proper name voldemort professor mcgonagall flinched but dumbledore who unsticking two lemon drops seemed not notice all gets so confusing if we keep saying you know who i have never seen any reason be frightened saying voldemorts name i know you havent said professor mcgonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring but youre different everyone knows youre only one you  know  oh all right voldemort frightened you flatter me said dumbledore calmly voldemort had powers i will never have only because youre too  well  noble use them its lucky its dark i havent blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs professor mcgonagall shot sharp look at dumbledore said owls are nothing next rumors that are flying around you know what everyones saying about why hes disappeared about what finally stopped him seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached point she most anxious discuss real reason she had been waiting on cold hard wall all day for neither as cat nor as woman had she fixed dumbledore with such piercing stare as she did now plain that whatever everyone saying she not going believe until dumbledore told her true dumbledore however choosing another lemon drop did not answer what theyre saying she pressed on is that last night voldemort turned up godrics hollow went find potters rumor is that lily james potter are  are  that theyre  dead dumbledore bowed his head professor mcgonagall gasped lily james  i cant believe  i didnt want believe  oh albus  dumbledore reached out patted her on shoulder i know  i know  said heavily professor mcgonagalls voice trembled as she went on thats not all theyre saying tried kill potters son but  couldnt couldnt kill that little boy no one knows why or how but theyre saying that when couldnt kill potter voldemorts power somehow broke  thats why hes gone dumbledore nodded glumly its  its true faltered professor mcgonagall after all hes done  all people hes killed  couldnt kill little boy its just astounding  all things stop him    but how name heaven did survive we can only guess said dumbledore we may never know professor mcgonagall pulled out lace handkerchief dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles dumbledore gave great sniff as took golden watch from his pocket examined it very odd watch had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets were moving around edge must have made sense dumbledore though because put back his pocket said hagrids late i suppose who told you id be here by way yes said professor mcgonagall i dont suppose youre going tell me why youre here all places ive come bring his aunt uncle theyre only family has left now you dont mean  you cant mean people who live here cried professor mcgonagall jumping her feet pointing at number four dumbledore  you cant ive been watching them all day you couldnt find two people who are less like us theyve got this son  i saw him kicking his mother all way up street screaming for sweets potter come live here its best place for him said dumbledore firmly his aunt uncle will be able explain everything him when hes older ive written them letter letter repeated professor mcgonagall faintly sitting back down on wall really dumbledore you think you can explain all this letter these people will never understand him hell be famous  legend  i wouldnt be surprised if today known as potter day future  there will be books written about  every child our world will know his name exactly said dumbledore looking very seriously over top his half moon glasses would be enough turn any boys head famous before can walk talk famous for something wont even remember cant you see how much better off hell be growing up away from all that until hes ready take professor mcgonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed then said yes  yes youre right course but how is boy getting here dumbledore she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought might be hiding underneath hagrids bringing him you think  wise  trust hagrid with something as important as this i would trust hagrid with my life said dumbledore im not saying his heart isnt right place said professor mcgonagall grudgingly but you cant pretend hes not careless does tend  what that low rumbling sound had broken silence around them grew steadily louder as they looked up down street for some sign headlight swelled roar as they both looked up at sky  huge motorcycle fell out air landed on road front them if motorcycle huge nothing man sitting astride almost twice as tall as normal man at least five times as wide looked simply too big be allowed so wild  long tangles bushy black hair beard hid most his face had hands size trash can lids his feet their leather boots were like baby dolphins his vast muscular arms holding bundle blankets hagrid said dumbledore sounding relieved at last where did you get that motorcycle borrowed professor dumbledore sir said giant climbing carefully off motorcycle as spoke young sirius black lent me ive got him sir no problems were there no sir  house almost destroyed but i got him out all right before muggles started swarmin around fell asleep as we flyin over bristol dumbledore professor mcgonagall bent forward over bundle blankets inside just visible baby boy fast asleep under tuft jet black hair over his forehead they could see curiously shaped cut like bolt lightning is that where   whispered professor mcgonagall yes said dumbledore hell have that scar forever couldnt you do something about dumbledore even if i could i wouldnt scars can come handy i have one myself above my left knee that is perfect map london underground well  give him here hagrid  wed better get this over with dumbledore took his arms turned toward dursleys house could i  could i say good bye him sir asked hagrid bent his great shaggy head over gave him what must have been very scratchy whiskery kiss then suddenly hagrid let out howl like wounded dog shhh hissed professor mcgonagall youll wake muggles s s sorry sobbed hagrid taking out large spotted handkerchief burying his face but i c c  cant stand  lily an james dead  an poor little off ter live with muggles   yes yes its all very sad but get grip on yourself hagrid or well be found professor mcgonagall whispered patting hagrid gingerly on arm as dumbledore stepped over low garden wall walked front door laid gently on doorstep took letter out his cloak tucked inside harrys blankets then came back other two for full minute three them stood looked at little bundle hagrids shoulders shook professor mcgonagall blinked furiously twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledores eyes seemed have gone out well said dumbledore finally thats that weve no business staying here we may as well go join celebrations yeah said hagrid very muffled voice id best get this bike away g night professor mcgonagall  professor dumbledore sir wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve hagrid swung himself onto motorcycle kicked engine into life with roar rose into air off into night i shall see you soon i expect professor mcgonagall said dumbledore nodding her professor mcgonagall blew her nose reply dumbledore turned walked back down street on corner stopped took out silver put  outer clicked once twelve balls light sped back their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange could make out tabby cat slinking around corner at other end street could just see bundle blankets on step number four good luck murmured turned on his heel with swish his cloak gone breeze ruffled neat hedges privet drive which lay silent tidy under inky sky very last place you would expect astonishing things happen potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up one small hand closed on letter beside him slept on not knowing special not knowing famous not knowing would be woken few hours time by mrs dursleys scream as she opened front door put out milk bottles nor that would spend next few weeks being prodded pinched by his cousin dudley  couldnt know that at this very moment people meeting secret all over country were holding up their glasses saying hushed voices potter  boy who lived vanashig glass nearly ten years had passed since dursleys had woken up find their nephew on front step but privet drive had hardly changed at all sun rose on same tidy front gardens lit up brass number four on dursleys front door crept into their living room which almost exactly same as had been on night when mr dursley had seen that fateful news report about owls only photographs on mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed ten years ago there had been lots pictures what looked like large pink beach ball wearing different colored bonnets  but dudley dursley no longer baby now photographs showed large blond boy riding his first bicycle on carousel at fair playing computer game with his father being hugged kissed by his mother room held no sign at all that another boy lived house too yet potter still there asleep at moment but not for long his aunt petunia awake her shrill voice that made first noise day up get up now woke with start his aunt rapped on door again up she screeched heard her walking toward kitchen then sound frying

punching bag but couldnt often catch him didnt look but very fast perhaps had something do with living dark cupboard but had always been small skinny for his age looked even smaller skinnier than really because all had wear were old clothes dudleys dudley about four times bigger than had thin face knobbly knees black hair bright green eyes wore round glasses held together with lot scotch tape because all times dudley had punched him on nose only thing liked about his own appearance very thin scar on his forehead that shaped like bolt lightning had had as long as could remember first question could ever remember asking his aunt petunia how had gotten car crash when your parents died she had said dont ask questions dont ask questions  that first rule for quiet life with dursleys uncle vernon entered kitchen as turning over bacon comb your hair barked by way morning greeting about once week uncle vernon looked over top his newspaper shouted that needed haircut must have had more haircuts than rest boys his class put together but made no difference his hair simply grew that way  all over place frying eggs by time dudley arrived kitchen with his mother dudley looked lot like uncle vernon had large pink face not much neck small watery blue eyes thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like baby angel  often said that dudley looked like pig wig put plates egg bacon on table which difficult as there wasnt much room dudley meanwhile counting his presents his face fell thirty six said looking up at his mother father thats two less than last year darling you havent counted auntie marges present see its here under this big one from mommy daddy all right thirty seven then said dudley going red face who

nine sweetums said aunt petunia oh dudley sat down heavily grabbed nearest parcel all right then uncle vernon chuckled little tyke wants his moneys worth just like his father atta boy dudley ruffled dudleys hair at that moment telephone rang aunt petunia went answer while uncle vernon watched dudley unwrap racing bike video camera remote control airplane sixteen new computer games vcr ripping paper off gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came back from telephone looking both angry worried bad news vernon she said mrs figgs broken her leg she cant take him she jerked her head harrys direction

want  him  t t come dudley yelled between huge pretend sobs always sp  spoils everything shot nasty grin through gap his mothers arms just then doorbell rang  oh good lord theyre here said aunt petunia frantically  moment later dudleys best friend piers polkiss walked with his mother piers scrawny boy with face like rat usually one who held peoples arms behind their backs while dudley hit them dudley stopped pretending cry at once half an hour later who couldnt believe his luck sitting back dursleys car with piers dudley on way zoo for first time his life his aunt uncle hadnt been able think anything else do with him but before theyd left uncle vernon had taken aside im warning you had said putting his large purple face right up close harrys im warning you now boy  any funny business anything at all  youll be that cupboard from now until christmas im not going do anything said honestly but uncle vernon didnt believe him no one ever did problem strange things often happened around just no good telling dursleys didnt make them happen once aunt petunia tired coming back from barbers looking as though hadnt been at all had taken pair kitchen scissors cut his hair so short almost bald except for his bangs which she left hide that horrible scar dudley had laughed himself silly at who spent sleepless night imagining school next day where already laughed at for his baggy clothes taped glasses next morning however had gotten up find his hair exactly as had been before aunt petunia had sheared off had been given week his cupboard for this even though had tried explain that couldnt explain how had grown back so quickly another time aunt petunia had been trying force him into revolting old sweater dudleys brown with orange puff balls harder she tried pull over his head smaller seemed become until finally might have fitted hand puppet but certainly wouldnt fit aunt petunia had decided must have shrunk wash his great relief wasnt punished on other hand hed gotten into terrible trouble for being found on roof school kitchens dudleys gang had been chasing him as usual when as much harrys surprise as anyone elses there sitting on chimney dursleys had received very angry letter from harrys headmistress telling them had been climbing school buildings but all hed tried do as shouted at uncle vernon through locked door his cupboard jump behind big trash cans outside kitchen doors supposed that wind must have caught him mid jump but today nothing going go wrong even worth being with dudley piers be spending day somewhere that wasnt school his cupboard or mrs figgs cabbage smelling living room while drove uncle vernon complained aunt petunia liked complain about things people at work council bank were just few his favorite subjects this morning motorcycles  roaring along like maniacs young hoodlums said as motorcycle overtook them i had dream about motorcycle said remembering suddenly flying uncle vernon nearly crashed into car front turned right around his seat yelled at his face like gigantic beet with mustache motorcycles dont fly dudley piers sniggered i know they dont said only dream but wished hadnt said anything if there one thing dursleys hated even more than his asking questions his talking about anything acting way shouldnt no matter if dream or even cartoon  they seemed think might get dangerous ideas very sunny saturday zoo crowded with families dursleys bought dudley piers large chocolate ice creams at entrance then because smiling lady van had asked what wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him cheap lemon ice pop wasnt bad either thought licking as they watched gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like dudley except that wasnt blond had best morning hed had long time careful walk little way apart from dursleys so that dudley piers who were starting get bored with animals by lunchtime wouldnt fall back on their favorite hobby hitting him they ate zoo restaurant when dudley had tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didnt have enough ice cream on top uncle vernon bought him another one allowed finish first felt afterward that should have known all too good last after lunch they went reptile house cool dark there with lit windows all along walls behind glass all sorts lizards snakes were crawling slithering over bits wood stone dudley piers wanted see huge poisonous cobras thick man crushing pythons dudley quickly found largest snake place could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernons car crushed into trash can  but at moment didnt look mood fact fast asleep dudley stood with his nose pressed against glass staring at glistening brown coils make move whined at his father uncle vernon tapped on glass but snake didnt budge do again dudley ordered uncle vernon rapped glass smartly with his knuckles but snake just snoozed on this is boring dudley moaned shuffled away moved front tank looked intently at snake wouldnt have been surprised if had died boredom itself  no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on glass trying disturb all day long worse than having cupboard as bedroom where only visitor aunt petunia hammering on door wake you up at least got visit rest house snake suddenly opened its beady eyes slowly very slowly raised its head until its eyes were on level with harrys winked stared then looked quickly around see if anyone watching they werent looked back at snake winked too snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon dudley then raised its eyes ceiling gave look that said quite plainly i get that all time i know murmured through glass though wasnt sure snake could hear him must be really annoying snake nodded vigorously where do you come from anyway asked snake jabbed its tail at little sign next glass peered at boa constrictor brazil nice there boa constrictor jabbed its tail at sign again read on this specimen bred zoo oh i see  so youve never been brazil as snake shook its head deafening shout behind made both them jump dudley mr dursley come look at this snake you wont believe what its doing dudley came waddling toward them as fast as could out way you said punching ribs caught by surprise fell hard on concrete floor what came next happened so fast no one saw how happened  one second piers dudley were leaning right up close glass next they had leapt back with howls horror sat up gasped glass front boa constrictors tank had vanished great snake uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto floor people throughout reptile house screamed started running for exits as snake slid swiftly past him could have sworn low hissing voice said brazil here i come  thanksss amigo keeper reptile house shock but glass kept saying where did glass go  zoo director himself made aunt petunia cup strong sweet tea while apologized over over again piers dudley could only gibber as far as had seen snake hadnt done anything except snap playfully at their heels as passed but by time they were all back uncle vernons car dudley telling them how had nearly bitten off his leg while piers swearing had tried squeeze him death but worst all for at least piers calming down enough say talking werent you uncle vernon waited until piers safely out house before starting on so angry could hardly speak managed say go  cupboard  stay  no meals before collapsed into chair aunt petunia had run get him large brandy lay his dark cupboard much later wishing had watch didnt know what time couldnt be sure dursleys were asleep yet until they were couldnt risk sneaking kitchen for some food hed lived with dursleys almost ten years ten miserable years as long as could remember ever since hed been baby his parents had died that car crash couldnt remember being car when his parents had

where all green light came from couldnt remember his parents at all his aunt uncle never spoke about them course forbidden ask questions there were no photographs them house when had been younger had dreamed dreamed some unknown relation coming take him away but had never happened dursleys were his only family yet sometimes thought or maybe hoped that strangers street seemed know him very strange strangers they were too tiny man violet top hat had bowed him once while out shopping with aunt petunia dudley after asking furiously if knew man aunt petunia had rushed them out shop without buying anything wild looking old woman dressed all green had waved merrily at him once on bus bald man very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand street other day then walked away without word

dursleys stole downstairs without turning on any lights going wait for postman on corner privet drive get letters for number four first his heart hammered as crept across dark hall toward front door  aaaaarrrgh   leapt into air hed trodden on something big squashy on doormat  something alive lights clicked on upstairs his horror realized that big squashy something had been his uncles face uncle vernon had been lying at foot front door sleeping bag clearly making sure that didnt do exactly what hed been trying do shouted at for about half an hour then told him go make cup tea shuffled miserably off into kitchen by time got back mail had arrived right into uncle vernons lap could see three letters addressed green ink i want   began but uncle vernon tearing letters into pieces before

letters arrived for as they couldnt go through mail slot they had been pushed under door slotted through sides few even forced through small window downstairs bathroom uncle vernon stayed at home again after burning all letters got out hammer nails boarded up cracks around front back doors so no one could go out hummed tiptoe through tulips as worked jumped at small noises on saturday things began get out hand twenty four letters found their way into house rolled up hidden inside each two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed aunt petunia through living room window while uncle vernon made furious telephone calls post office dairy trying find someone complain aunt petunia shredded letters her food processor who on earth wants talk you this badly dudley asked amazement k k k on sunday morning uncle vernon sat down at breakfast table looking tired rather ill but happy no post on sundays reminded them cheerfully as spread marmalade on his newspapers no damn letters today   something came whizzing down kitchen chimney as spoke caught him sharply on back head next moment thirty or forty letters came pelting out fireplace like bullets dursleys ducked but leapt into air trying catch one  out out uncle vernon seized around waist threw him into hall when aunt petunia dudley had run out with their arms over their faces uncle vernon slammed door shut they could hear letters still streaming into room bouncing off walls floor that does said uncle vernon trying speak calmly but pulling great tufts out his mustache at same time i want you all back here five minutes ready leave were going away just pack some clothes no arguments looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through boarded up doors were car speeding toward highway dudley sniffling back seat his father had hit him round head for holding them up while tried pack his television vcr computer his sports bag they drove they drove even aunt petunia didnt dare ask where they were going every now then uncle vernon would take sharp turn drive opposite direction for while shake em off  shake em off would mutter whenever did this they didnt stop eat or drink all day by nightfall dudley howling hed never had such bad day his life hungry hed missed five television programs hed wanted see hed never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer uncle vernon stopped at last outside gloomy  looking hotel on outskirts big city dudley shared room with twin beds damp musty sheets dudley snored but stayed awake sitting on windowsill staring down at lights passing cars wondering they ate stale cornflakes cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast next day they had just finished when owner hotel came over their table  scuse me but is one you mr h potter only i got about an undred these at front desk she held up letter so they could read green ink address mr h potter room   railview hotel cokeworth made grab for letter but uncle vernon knocked his hand out way woman stared ill take them said uncle vernon standing up quickly following her from dining room k k k wouldnt be better just go home dear aunt petunia suggested timidly hours later but uncle vernon didnt seem hear her exactly what looking for none them knew drove them into middle forest got out looked around shook his head got back car off they went again same thing happened middle plowed field halfway across suspension bridge at top multilevel parking garage daddys gone mad hasnt dudley asked aunt petunia dully late that afternoon uncle vernon had parked at coast locked them all inside car disappeared started rain great drops beat on roof car dudley sniveled its monday told his mother great humbertos on tonight i want stay

birthdays were never exactly fun  last year dursleys had given him coat hanger pair uncle vernons old socks still you werent eleven every day uncle vernon back smiling also carrying long thin package didnt answer aunt petunia when she asked what hed bought found perfect place said come on everyone out very cold outside car uncle vernon pointing at what looked like large rock way out at sea perched on top rock most miserable little shack you could imagine one thing certain there no television there storm forecast for tonight said uncle vernon gleefully clapping his hands together this gentlemans kindly agreed lend us his boat toothless old man came ambling up them pointing with rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing iron gray water below them ive already got us some rations said uncle vernon so all aboard freezing boat icy sea spray rain crept down their necks chilly wind whipped their faces after what seemed like hours they reached rock where uncle vernon slipping sliding led way broken down house inside horrible smelled strongly seaweed wind whistled through gaps wooden walls fireplace damp empty there were only two rooms uncle vernons rations turned out be bag chips each four bananas tried start fire but empty chip bags just smoked shriveled up could do with some those letters now eh said cheerfully very good mood obviously thought nobody stood chance reaching them here storm deliver mail privately agreed though thought didnt cheer him up at all as night fell promised storm blew up around them spray from high waves splattered walls hut fierce wind rattled filthy windows aunt petunia found few moldy blankets second room made up bed for dudley on moth eaten sofa she uncle vernon went off lumpy bed next door left find softest bit floor could curl up under thinnest most ragged blanket storm raged more more ferociously as night went on couldnt sleep shivered turned over trying get comfortable his stomach rumbling with hunger dudleys snores were drowned by low rolls thunder that started near midnight lighted dial dudleys watch which dangling over edge sofa on his fat wrist told hed be eleven ten minutes time lay watched his birthday tick nearer wondering if dursleys would remember at all wondering where letter writer now five minutes go heard something creak outside hoped roof wasnt going fall although might be warmer if did four minutes go maybe house privet drive would be so full letters when they got back that hed be able steal one somehow three minutes go that sea slapping hard on rock like that two minutes go what that funny crunching noise rock crumbling into sea one minute go hed be eleven thirty seconds  twenty  ten  nine  maybe hed wake dudley up just annoy him  three  two  one  boom whole shack shivered sat bolt upright staring at door someone outside knocking come keeper keys boom they knocked again dudley jerked awake wheres cannon said stupidly there crash behind them uncle vernon came skidding into room holding rifle his hands  now they knew what had been long thin package had brought with them whos there shouted i warn you  im armed there pause then  smash door hit with such force that swung clean off its hinges with deafening crash landed flat on floor giant man standing doorway his face almost completely hidden by long shaggy mane hair wild tangled beard but you could make out his eyes glinting like black beetles under all hair giant squeezed his way into hut stooping so that his head just brushed ceiling bent down picked up door fitted easily back into its frame noise storm outside dropped little turned look at them all couldnt make us cup o tea could yeh its not been an easy journey  strode over sofa where dudley sat frozen with fear budge up yeh great lump said stranger dudley squeaked ran hide behind his mother who crouching terrified behind uncle vernon an heres said giant looked up into fierce wild shadowy face saw that beetle eyes were crinkled smile las time i saw you

dursley yeh great prune said giant reached over back sofa jerked gun out uncle vernons hands bent into knot as easily as if had been made rubber threw into corner room uncle vernon made another funny noise like mouse being trodden on anyway  said giant turning his back on dursleys very happy birthday yeh got summat fer yeh here  i mighta sat on at some point but itll taste all right from an inside pocket his black overcoat pulled slightly squashed box opened with trembling fingers inside large sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday written on green icing looked up at giant meant say thank

harrys whole arm what about that tea then eh said rubbing his hands together id not say no ter summat stronger if yehve got mind his eyes fell on empty grate with shriveled chip bags snorted bent down over fireplace they couldnt see what doing but when drew back second later there roaring fire there filled whole damp hut with flickering light felt warmth wash over him as though hed sunk into hot bath giant sat back down on sofa which sagged under his weight began taking all sorts things out pockets his coat copper kettle squashy package sausages poker teapot several chipped mugs bottle some amber liquid that took swig from before starting make tea soon hut full sound smell sizzling sausage nobody said thing while giant working but as slid first six fat juicy slightly burnt sausages from poker dudley fidgeted little uncle vernon said sharply dont touch anything gives you dudley giant chuckled darkly yer great puddin son don need fattenin anymore dursley don worry passed sausages who so hungry had never tasted anything so wonderful but still couldnt take his eyes off giant finally as nobody seemed about explain anything said im sorry but i still dont really know who you are giant took gulp tea wiped his mouth with back his hand call me hagrid said everyone does an like i told yeh im keeper keys at hogwarts  yehll know all about hogwarts o course er  no said hagrid looked

finally uncle vernon suddenly found his voice stop commanded stop right there sir i forbid you tell boy anything braver man than vernon dursley would have quailed under furious look hagrid now gave him when hagrid spoke his every syllable trembled with rage you never told him never told him what letter dumbledore left fer him i there i saw dumbledore leave dursley an youve kept from him all

rather ruffled looking owl  long quill roll parchment with his tongue between his teeth scribbled note that could read upside down dear professor dumbledore given his letter taking him buy his things tomorrow weathers horrible hope youre well hagrid hagrid rolled up note gave owl which clamped its beak went door threw owl out into storm then came back sat down as though this as normal as talking on telephone realized his mouth open closed quickly where i said hagrid but at that moment uncle vernon still ashen faced but looking very angry moved into firelight hes not going said hagrid grunted id like ter see great muggle like you stop him said what said interested muggle said hagrid its what we call nonmagic folk like them an its your bad luck you grew up family o biggest muggles i ever laid eyes on we swore when we took him wed put stop that rubbish said uncle vernon swore wed stamp out him wizard indeed you knew said you knew im  wizard knew shrieked aunt petunia suddenly knew

then if you please she went got herself blown up we got landed with you had gone very white as soon as found his voice said blown up you told me they died car crash car crash roared hagrid jumping up so angrily that dursleys scuttled back their corner how could car crash kill lily an james potter its an outrage scandal potter not knowin his own story when every kid our world knows his name but why what happened asked urgently anger faded from hagrids face looked suddenly anxious i never expected this said low worried voice i had no idea when dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin hold yeh how much yeh didnt know ah i don know if im right person ter tell yeh  but someones gotta  yeh cant go off ter hogwarts not knowin threw dirty look at dursleys well its best yeh know as much as i can tell yeh  mind i cant tell yeh everythin its great mystry parts  sat down stared into fire for few seconds then said begins i suppose with  with person called  but its incredible yeh dont know his name everyone our world knows   who well  i don like sayin name if i can help no one does why not gulpin gargoyles people are still scared blimey this is difficult see there this wizard who went  bad as bad as you could go worse worse than worse his name  hagrid gulped but no words came out could you write down suggested nah  cant spell all right  voldemort hagrid shuddered don make me say again anyway this  this wizard about twenty years ago now started lookin fer followers got em too  some were afraid some just wanted bit o his power cause gettin himself power all right dark days didnt know who ter trust didnt dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches    terrible things happened takin over course some stood up him  an killed em horribly one o only safe places left hogwarts reckon dumbledores only one you know who afraid didnt dare try takin school not jus then anyway now yer mum an dad were as good witch an wizard as i ever knew head boy an girl at hogwarts their day suppose mystry is why you know  who never tried get em on his side before    probably knew they were too close ter dumbledore ter want anythin ter do with dark side maybe thought could persuade em  maybe just wanted em outta way all anyone knows is turned up village where you all living on halloween ten years ago you just year old came ter yer house an  an   hagrid suddenly pulled out very dirty spotted handkerchief blew his nose with sound like foghorn sorry said but its that sad  knew yer mum an dad an nicer people yeh couldnt find  anyway you know who killed em an then  an this is real mystry thing  tried kill you too wanted ter make clean job i suppose or maybe just liked killin by then but couldnt do never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead that no ordinary cut thats what yeh get when powerful evil curse touches yeh  took care yer mum an dad an yer house even  but didnt work on you an thats why yer famous no one ever lived after decided ter kill em no one except you an hed killed some o best witches an wizards age  mckinnons bones prewetts  an you only baby an you lived something very painful going on harrys mind as hagrids story came close saw again blinding flash green light more clearly than had ever remembered before  remembered something else for first time his life high cold cruel laugh hagrid watching him sadly took yeh from ruined house myself on dumbledores orders brought yeh ter this lot  load old tosh said uncle vernon jumped had almost forgotten that dursleys were there uncle vernon certainly seemed have got back his courage glaring at hagrid his fists were clenched now you listen here boy snarled i accept theres something strange about you probably nothing good beating wouldnt have cured  as for all this about your parents well they were weirdos no denying worlds better off without them my opinion  asked for all they got getting mixed up with these wizarding types  just what i expected always knew theyd come sticky end   but at that moment hagrid leapt from sofa drew battered pink umbrella from inside his coat pointing this at uncle vernon like sword said im warning you dursley  im warning you  one more word  danger being speared on end an umbrella by bearded giant uncle vernons courage failed again flattened himself against wall fell silent thats better said hagrid breathing heavily sitting back down on sofa which this time sagged right down floor meanwhile still had questions ask hundreds them but what happened vol  sorry  i mean you  know who good question disappeared vanished same night tried ter kill you makes yeh even more famous thats biggest mystry see  gettin more an more powerful  whyd go some say died codswallop my opinion dunno if had enough human left him die some say hes still out there bidin his time like but i don believe people who on his side came back ter ours some em came outta kinda trances don reckon they couldve done if cornin back most us reckon hes still out there somewhere but lost his powers too weak carry on cause somethin about you finished him there somethin goin on that night hadnt counted on   dunno what no one does  but somethin about you stumped him all right hagrid looked at with warmth respect blazing his eyes but instead feeling pleased proud felt quite sure there had been horrible mistake wizard him how could possibly be hed spent his life being clouted by dudley bullied by aunt petunia uncle vernon if really wizard why hadnt they been turned into warty toads every time theyd tried lock him his cupboard if hed once defeated greatest sorcerer world how come dudley had always been able kick him around like football hagrid said quietly i think you must have made mistake i dont think i can be wizard his surprise hagrid chuckled not wizard eh never made things happen when you scared or angry looked into fire now came think about    every odd thing that had ever made his aunt uncle furious with him had happened when had been upset or angry  chased by dudleys gang had somehow found himself out their reach    dreading going school with that ridiculous haircut hed managed make grow back    very last time dudley had hit him hadnt got his revenge without even realizing doing hadnt set boa constrictor on him looked back at hagrid smiling saw that hagrid positively beaming at him see said hagrid potter not wizard  you wait youll be right famous

me brought umbrella swishing down through air point at dudley  there flash violet light sound like firecracker sharp squeal next second dudley dancing on spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom howling pain when turned his back on them saw curly pigs tail poking through hole his trousers uncle vernon roared pulling aunt petunia dudley into other room cast one last terrified look at hagrid slammed door behind them hagrid looked down at his umbrella stroked his beard shouldnta lost me temper said ruefully but didnt work anyway meant ter turn him into pig but i suppose so much like

claw on window newspaper held its beak scrambled his feet so happy felt as though large balloon swelling inside him went straight window jerked open owl swooped dropped newspaper on top hagrid who didnt wake up owl then fluttered onto floor began attack hagrid s coat dont do that tried wave owl out way but snapped its beak fiercely at him carried on savaging coat hagrid said loudly theres an

teabags  finally pulled out handful strange looking coins give him five knuts said hagrid sleepily knuts little bronze ones counted out five little bronze coins owl held out his leg so could put money into small leather pouch tied then flew off through open window hagrid yawned loudly sat up stretched best be off lots ter do today gotta get up ter london an buy all yer stuff fer school turning over wizard coins looking at them had just thought something that made him feel as though happy balloon inside him had got puncture urn  hagrid mm said hagrid who pulling on his huge boots i havent got any

under underground yehd die hunger tryin ter get out even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat sat thought about this while hagrid read his newspaper daily prophet had learned from uncle

ministry magic asked before could stop himself  course said hagrid they wanted dumbledore fer minister o course but hed never leave hogwarts so old cornelius fudge got job bungler if ever there one so pelts dumbledore with owls every morning askin fer advice but what does ministry magic do well their main job is keep from muggles that theres still witches an wizards up an down country why why blimey everyone d be wantin magic solutions their problems nah were best left alone at this moment boat bumped gently into harbor wall hagrid folded up his newspaper they clambered up stone steps onto street passersby stared lot at hagrid as they walked through little town station couldnt blame them not only hagrid twice as tall as anyone else kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters saying loudly see that things these muggles dream up eh hagrid said panting bit as ran keep up did you say there are dragons at gringotts well so they say said hagrid crikey id like dragon youd like one wanted one ever since i kid  here we go they had reached station there train london five minutes time hagrid who didnt understand muggle money as called gave bills so could buy their tickets

dont know how muggles manage without magic said as they climbed broken down escalator that led up bustling road lined with shops hagrid so huge that parted crowd easily all had do keep close behind him they passed book shops music stores hamburger restaurants cinemas but nowhere that looked as if could sell you magic wand this just an ordinary street full ordinary people could there really be piles wizard gold buried miles beneath them were there really shops that sold spell books broomsticks might this not all be some huge joke that dursleys had cooked up if hadnt known that dursleys had no sense humor might have thought so yet somehow even though everything hagrid had told him so far unbelievable couldnt help trusting him this is said hagrid coming halt leaky cauldron its famous place tiny grubby looking pub if hagrid hadnt pointed out wouldnt have noticed there people hurrying by didnt glance at their eyes slid from big book shop on one side record shop on other as if they

globes moon  gringotts said hagrid they had reached snowy white building that towered over other little shops standing beside its burnished bronze doors wearing uniform scarlet gold  yeah thats goblin said hagrid quietly as they walked up white stone steps toward him goblin about head shorter than had swarthy clever face pointed beard noticed very long fingers feet bowed as they walked inside now they were facing second pair doors silver this time with words engraved upon them enter stranger but take heed what awaits sin greed for those who take but do not earn must pay most dearly their turn so if you seek beneath our floors treasure that never yours thief you have been warned beware finding more than treasure there like i said yehd be mad ter try an rob said hagrid pair goblins bowed them through silver doors they were vast marble hall about hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind long counter scribbling large ledgers weighing coins brass scales examining precious stones through eyeglasses there were too many doors count leading off hall yet more goblins were showing people out these hagrid made for counter morning said hagrid free goblin weve come ter take some money outta mr potters safe you have his key sir got here somewhere said hagrid started emptying his pockets onto counter scattering handful moldy dog biscuits over goblins book numbers goblin wrinkled his nose watched goblin on their right weighing pile rubies as big as glowing coals got said hagrid at last holding up tiny golden key goblin looked at closely that seems be order an ive also got letter here from professor dumbledore said hagrid importantly throwing out his chest its about you know what vault seven hundred thirteen goblin read letter carefully very well said handing back hagrid i will have someone take you down both vaults griphook griphook yet another goblin once hagrid had crammed all dog biscuits back inside his pockets followed griphook toward one doors leading off hall whats you know what vault seven hundred thirteen asked cant tell yeh that said hagrid mysteriously very secret hogwarts business dumbledores trusted me moren my jobs worth ter tell yeh that griphook held door open for them who had expected more marble surprised they were narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches sloped steeply downward there were little railway tracks on floor griphook whistled small cart came hurtling up tracks toward them they climbed  hagrid with some difficulty  were off at first they just hurtled through maze twisting passages tried remember left right right left middle fork right left but impossible rattling cart seemed know its own way because griphook wasnt steering harrys eyes stung as cold air rushed past them but kept them wide open once thought saw burst fire at end passage twisted around see if dragon but too late  they plunged even deeper passing an underground lake where huge stalactites stalagmites grew from ceiling floor i never know called hagrid over noise cart whats difference between stalagmite stalactite stalagmites got an m said hagrid an don ask me questions just now i think im gonna be sick did look very green when cart stopped at last beside small door passage wall hagrid got out had lean against wall stop his knees from trembling griphook unlocked door lot green smoke came billowing out as cleared gasped inside were mounds gold coins columns silver heaps little bronze knuts all yours smiled hagrid all harrys  incredible dursleys couldnt have known about this or theyd have had from him faster than blinking how often had they complained how much cost them keep all time there had been small fortune belonging him buried deep under london hagrid helped pile some into bag gold ones are galleons explained seventeen silver sickles galleon twenty nine knuts sickle its easy enough right that should be enough fer couple o terms well keep rest safe for yeh turned griphook vault seven hundred thirteen now please can we go more slowly one speed only said griphook they were going even deeper now gathering speed air became colder colder as they hurtled round tight corners they went rattling over an underground ravine leaned over side try see what down at dark bottom but hagrid groaned pulled him back by scruff his neck vault seven hundred thirteen had no keyhole stand back said griphook importantly stroked door gently with one his long fingers simply melted away if anyone but gringotts goblin tried that theyd be sucked through door trapped there said griphook how often do you check see if anyones inside asked about once every ten years said griphook with rather nasty grin something really extraordinary had be inside this top security vault sure leaned forward eagerly expecting see fabulous jewels at very least  but at first thought empty then noticed grubby little package wrapped up brown paper lying on floor hagrid picked up tucked deep inside his coat longed know what but knew better than ask come on back this infernal cart dont talk me on way back its best if i keep me mouth shut said hagrid one wild cart ride later they stood blinking sunlight outside gringotts didnt

then they visited apothecary which fascinating enough make up for its horrible smell mixture bad eggs rotted cabbages barrels slimy stuff stood on floor jars herbs dried roots bright powders lined walls bundles feathers strings fangs snarled claws hung from ceiling while hagrid asked man behind counter for supply some basic potion ingredients for harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at

don expect youve had lotta presents from them dursleys just ollivanders left now  only place fer wands ollivanders yeh gotta have best wand magic wand    this what had been really looking forward last shop narrow shabby peeling gold letters over door read ollivanders makers fine wands since b c single wand lay on faded purple cushion dusty window tinkling bell rang somewhere depths shop as they stepped inside tiny place empty except for single spindly chair that hagrid sat on wait felt strangely as though had entered very strict library swallowed lot new questions that had just occurred him looked instead at thousands narrow boxes piled neatly right up ceiling for some reason back his neck prickled very dust silence here seemed tingle with some secret magic good afternoon said soft voice jumped hagrid must have jumped too because there loud crunching noise got quickly off spindly chair an old man standing before them his wide pale eyes shining like moons through gloom shop hello said awkwardly ah yes said man yes yes i thought id be seeing you soon potter wasnt question you have your mothers eyes seems only yesterday she here herself buying her first wand ten quarter inches long swishy made willow nice wand for charm work mr ollivander moved closer harry wished would blink those silvery eyes were bit creepy your father on other hand favored mahogany wand eleven inches pliable little more power excellent for transfiguration well i say your father favored  its really wand that chooses wizard course mr ollivander had come so close that were almost nose nose could see himself reflected those misty eyes thats where  mr ollivander touched lightning scar on harrys forehead with long white finger im sorry say i sold wand that did said softly thirteen half inches yew powerful

his feet ive still got pieces though added brightly but you dont use them said mr ollivander sharply oh no sir said hagrid quickly noticed gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as spoke hmmm said mr ollivander giving hagrid piercing look well now  mr potter let me see pulled long tape measure with silver markings out his pocket which is your wand arm er  well im right handed said hold out your arm thats measured from shoulder finger then wrist elbow shoulder floor knee armpit round his head as measured said every ollivander wand has core powerful magical substance mr potter we use unicorn hairs phoenix tail feathers heartstrings dragons no two ollivander wands are same just as no two unicorns dragons or phoenixes are quite same course you will never get such good results with another wizards wand suddenly realized that tape measure which measuring between his nostrils doing this on its own mr ollivander flitting around shelves taking down boxes that will do said tape measure crumpled into heap on floor right then mr potter try this one beech wood dragon heartstring nine inches nice flexible just take give wave took wand feeling foolish waved around bit but mr ollivander snatched out his hand almost at once maple phoenix feather seven inches quite whippy try   tried  but had hardly raised wand when too snatched back by mr ollivander no no  here ebony unicorn hair

curious indeed how these things happen wand chooses wizard remember  i think we must expect great things from you mr potter  after all who  must not be named did great things  terrible yes but great shivered wasnt sure liked mr ollivander too much paid seven gold galleons for his wand mr ollivander bowed them from his shop late afternoon sun hung low sky as hagrid made their way back down diagon alley back through wall back through leaky cauldron now empty didnt speak at all as they walked down road didnt even notice how much people were gawking at them on underground laden as they were with all their funny  shaped packages with snowy owl asleep its cage on harrys lap up another escalator out into paddington station only realized where they were when hagrid tapped him on shoulder got time

yell scabbers rat hanging off his finger sharp little teeth sunk deep into goyle s knuckle  crabbe malfoy backed away as goyle swung scabbers round round howling when scabbers finally flew off hit window all three them disappeared at once perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among sweets or perhaps theyd heard footsteps because second later hermione granger had come what has been going on she said looking at sweets all over floor ron picking up scabbers by his tail i think hes been knocked out ron said looked closer at scabbers no  i dont believe  hes gone back sleep so had

we change all right  i only came here because people outside are behaving very childishly racing up down corridors said hermione sniffy voice youve got dirt on your nose by way did you know ron glared at her as she left peered out window getting dark could see mountains forests under deep purple sky train did seem be slowing down ron took off their jackets pulled on their long black robes rons were bit short for him you could see his sneakers underneath them voice echoed through train we will be reaching hogwarts five minutes time please leave your luggage on train will be taken school separately harrys stomach lurched with nerves ron saw looked pale under his freckles they crammed their pockets with last sweets joined crowd thronging corridor train slowed right down finally stopped people pushed their way toward door out on tiny dark platform shivered cold night air then lamp came bobbing over heads students heard familiar voice firs years firs years over here all right there hagrids big hairy face beamed over sea heads cmon follow me  any more firs years mind yer step now firs years follow me slipping stumbling they followed hagrid down what seemed be steep narrow path so dark on either side them that thought there must be thick trees there nobody spoke much neville boy who kept losing his toad sniffed once or twice yehll get yer firs sight o hogwarts sec hagrid called over his shoulder jus round this bend here there loud oooooh narrow path had opened suddenly onto edge great black lake perched atop high mountain on other side its windows sparkling starry sky vast castle with many turrets towers no moren four boat hagrid called pointing fleet little boats sitting water by shore ron were followed into their boat by neville hermione everyone shouted hagrid who had boat himself right then  forward fleet little boats moved off all at once gliding across lake which as smooth as glass everyone silent staring up at great castle overhead towered over them as they sailed nearer nearer cliff on which stood heads down yelled hagrid as first boats reached cliff they all bent their heads little boats carried them through curtain ivy that hid wide opening cliff face they were carried along dark tunnel which seemed be taking them right underneath castle until they reached kind underground harbor where they clambered out onto rocks pebbles oy you there is this your toad said hagrid who checking boats as people climbed out them trevor cried neville blissfully holding out his hands then they clambered up passageway rock after hagrids lamp coming out at last onto smooth damp grass right shadow castle they walked up flight stone steps crowded around huge oak front door everyone here you there still got yer toad hagrid raised gigantic fist knocked three times on castle door  sorting hat door swung open at once tall black haired witch emerald green robes stood there she had very stern face harrys first thought that this not someone cross firs years professor mcgonagall said hagrid thank you hagrid i will take them from here she pulled door wide entrance hall so big you could have fit whole dursleys house stone walls were lit with flaming torches like ones at gringotts ceiling too high make out magnificent marble staircase facing them led upper floors they followed professor mcgonagall across flagged stone floor could hear drone hundreds voices from doorway right  rest school must already be here  but professor mcgonagall showed first years into small empty chamber off hall they crowded standing rather closer together than they would usually have done peering about nervously welcome hogwarts said professor mcgonagall start term banquet will begin shortly but before you take your seats great hall you will be sorted into your houses sorting is very important ceremony because while you are here your house will be something like your family within hogwarts you will have classes with rest your house sleep your house dormitory spend free time your house common room four houses are called gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw slytherin each house has its own noble history each has produced outstanding witches wizards while you are at hogwarts

house becomes yours sorting ceremony will take place few minutes front rest school i suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting her eyes lingered for moment on nevilles cloak which fastened under his left ear on rons smudged nose nervously tried flatten his hair i shall return when we are ready for you said professor mcgonagall please wait quietly she left chamber swallowed how exactly do they sort us into houses asked ron some sort test i think fred said hurts lot but i think joking harrys heart gave horrible jolt test front whole school but didnt know any magic yet  what on earth would have do hadnt expected something like this moment they arrived looked around anxiously saw that everyone else looked terrified too no one talking much except hermione granger who whispering very fast about all spells shed learned wondering which one shed need tried hard not listen her hed never been more nervous never not even when hed had take school report home dursleys saying that hed somehow turned his teachers wig blue kept his eyes fixed on door any second now professor mcgonagall would come back lead him his doom then something happened that made him jump about foot air  several people behind him screamed what   gasped so did people around him about twenty ghosts had just streamed through back wall pearly white slightly transparent they glided across room talking one another hardly glancing at first years they seemed be arguing what looked like fat little monk saying forgive forget i say we ought give him second chance   my dear friar havent we given peeves all chances deserves gives us all bad name you know hes not really even ghost  i say what are you all doing here ghost wearing ruff tights had suddenly noticed first years nobody answered new students said fat friar smiling around at them about be sorted i suppose few people nodded mutely hope see you hufflepuff said friar my old house you know move along now said sharp voice sorting ceremonys about start professor mcgonagall had returned one by one ghosts floated away through opposite wall now form line professor mcgonagall told first years follow me feeling oddly as though his legs had turned lead got into line behind boy with sandy hair with ron behind him they walked out chamber back across hall through pair double doors into great hall had never even imagined such strange splendid place lit by thousands thousands candles that were floating midair over four long tables where rest students were sitting these tables were laid with glittering golden plates goblets at top hall another long table where teachers were sitting professor mcgonagall led first years up here so that they came halt line facing other students with teachers behind them hundreds faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns flickering candlelight dotted here there among students ghosts shone misty silver mainly avoid all staring eyes looked upward saw velvety black ceiling dotted with stars heard hermione whisper its bewitched look like sky outside i read about hogwarts history hard believe there ceiling there at all that great hall didnt simply open on heavens quickly looked down again as professor mcgonagall silently placed four legged stool front first years on top stool she put pointed wizards hat this hat patched frayed extremely dirty aunt petunia wouldnt have let house maybe they had try get rabbit out thought wildly that seemed sort thing  noticing that everyone hall now staring at hat stared at too for few seconds there complete silence then hat twitched rip near brim opened wide like mouth  hat began sing oh you may not think im pretty but dont judge on what you see ill eat myself if you can find smarter hat than me you can keep your bowlers black your top hats sleek tall for im hogwarts sorting hat i can cap them all theres nothing hidden your head sorting hat cant see so try me on i will tell you where you ought be you might belong gryffindor where dwell brave at heart their daring nerve chivalry set gryffindors apart you might belong hufflepuff where they are just loyal those patient hufflepuffs are true unafraid toil or yet wise old ravenclaw if youve ready mind where those wit learning will always find their kind or perhaps slytherin youll make your real friends those cunning folk use any means achieve their ends so put me on dont be afraid l dont get flap youre safe hands though i have none for im thinking cap whole hall burst into applause as hat finished its song bowed each four tables then became quite still again so weve just got try on hat ron whispered ill kill fred going on about wrestling troll smiled weakly yes trying on hat lot better than having do spell but did wish they could have tried on without everyone watching hat seemed be asking rather lot didnt feel brave or quick witted or any at moment if only hat had mentioned house for people who felt bit queasy that would have been one for him professor mcgonagall now stepped forward holding long roll parchment when i call your name you will put on hat sit on stool be sorted she said abbott hannah pink faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out line put on hat which fell right down over her eyes sat down moments pause  hufflepuff shouted hat table on right cheered clapped as hannah went sit down at hufflepuff table saw ghost fat friar waving merrily at her bones susan hufflepuff shouted hat again susan scuttled off sit next hannah boot terry ravenclaw table second from left clapped this time several ravenclaws stood up shake hands with terry as joined them brocklehurst mandy went ravenclaw too but brown lavender became first new gryffindor table on far left exploded with cheers could see rons twin brothers catcalling

being picked for teams during gym at his old school had always been last be chosen not because no good but because no one wanted dudley think they liked him finch fletchley justin hufflepuff sometimes noticed hat shouted out house at once but at others took little while decide finnigan seamus sandy haired boy next line sat on stool for almost whole minute before hat declared him gryffindor granger hermione hermione almost ran stool jammed hat eagerly on her head gryffindor shouted hat ron groaned horrible thought struck as horrible thoughts always do when youre very nervous what if wasnt chosen at all what if just sat there with hat over his eyes for ages until professor mcgonagall jerked off his head said there had obviously been mistake hed better get back on train when neville longbottom boy who kept losing his toad called fell over on his way stool hat took long time decide with neville when finally shouted gryffindor neville ran off still wearing had jog back amid gales laughter give macdougal morag malfoy swaggered forward when his name called got his wish at once hat had barely touched his head when screamed slytherin malfoy went join his friends crabbe goyle looking pleased with himself there werent many people left now moon  nott   parkinson   then pair twin girls path path   then perks sally  anne     then at last  potter as stepped forward whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over hall  potter  did she say  potter last thing saw before hat dropped over his eyes hall full people craning get good look at him next second looking at black inside hat waited hmm said small voice his ear difficult very difficult plenty courage i see not bad mind either theres talent oh my goodness yes  nice thirst prove yourself now thats

relieved have been chosen not put slytherin hardly noticed that getting loudest cheer yet percy prefect got up shook his hand vigorously while weasley twins yelled we got potter we got potter sat down opposite ghost ruff hed seen earlier ghost patted his arm giving sudden horrible feeling hed just plunged into bucket ice cold water could see high table properly now at end nearest him sat hagrid who caught his eye gave him thumbs up grinned back there center high table large gold chair sat albus dumbledore recognized him at once from card hed gotten out chocolate frog on train dumbledores silver hair only thing whole hall that shone as brightly as ghosts spotted professor quirrell too nervous young man from leaky cauldron looking very peculiar large purple turban now there were only four people left be sorted thomas dean black boy even taller than ron joined at gryffindor table turpin lisa became ravenclaw then rons turn pale green by now crossed his fingers under table second later hat had shouted gryffindor clapped loudly with rest as ron collapsed into chair next him well done ron excellent said percy weasley pompously across as zabini blaise made slytherin professor mcgonagall rolled up her scroll took sorting hat away looked down at his empty gold plate had only just realized how hungry pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago albus dumbledore had gotten his feet beaming at students his arms opened wide as if nothing could have pleased him more than see them all there welcome said welcome new year at hogwarts before we begin our banquet i would like say few words here they are nitwit blubber oddment tweak thank you sat back down everybody clapped cheered didnt know whether laugh or not is  bit mad asked percy uncertainly mad said percy airily hes genius best wizard

sir nicholas de mimsy   ghost began stiffly but sandy haired seamus finnigan interrupted nearly headless how can you be nearly headless sir nicholas looked extremely miffed as if their little chat wasnt going at all way wanted like this said irritably seized his left ear pulled his whole head swung off his neck fell onto his shoulder as if on hinge someone had obviously tried behead him but not done properly looking pleased at stunned looks on their faces nearly headless nick flipped his head back onto his neck coughed said so  new gryffindors i hope youre going help us win house championship this year gryffindors have never gone so long without winning slytherins have got cup six years row bloody barons becoming almost unbearable  hes slytherin ghost looked over at slytherin table saw horrible ghost sitting there with blank staring eyes gaunt face robes stained with silver blood right next malfoy who pleased see didnt look too pleased with seating arrangements how did get covered blood asked seamus with great interest ive never asked said nearly headless nick delicately when everyone had eaten as much as they could remains food faded from plates leaving them sparkling clean as before moment later desserts appeared blocks ice cream every flavor you could think apple pies treacle tarts chocolate eclairs jam doughnuts trifle strawberries jell  0 rice pudding  as helped himself treacle tart talk turned their families im half half said seamus me dads muggle mom didnt tell him she witch til after they were married bit nasty shock for him others laughed what about you neville said ron well my gran brought me up shes witch said neville but family thought i all  muggle for ages my great uncle algie kept trying catch me off my guard force some magic out me  pushed me off end blackpool pier once i nearly drowned  but nothing happened until i eight great uncle algie came round for dinner hanging me out an upstairs window by ankles when my great auntie enid offered him meringue accidentally let go but i bounced  all way down garden into road they were all really pleased gran crying she so happy you should have seen their faces when i got here  they thought i might not be magic enough come you see great uncle algie so pleased bought me my toad on harrys other side percy weasley hermione were talking about lessons i do hope they start right away theres so much learn im particularly interested transfiguration you know turning something into something else course its supposed be very difficult  youll be starting small just matches into needles that sort thing   who starting feel warm sleepy looked up at high table again hagrid drinking deeply from his goblet professor mcgonagall talking professor dumbledore professor quirrell his absurd turban talking teacher with greasy black hair hooked nose sallow skin happened very suddenly hook nosed teacher looked past quirrells turban straight into harrys eyes  sharp hot pain shot across scar on harrys forehead ouch clapped hand his head what is asked percy n nothing pain had gone as quickly as had come harder shake off feeling had gotten from teachers look  feeling that didnt like at all whos that teacher talking professor quirrell asked percy oh you know quirrell already do you no wonder hes looking so nervous thats professor snape teaches potions but doesnt want  everyone knows hes after quirrells job knows an awful lot about dark arts snape watched snape for while but snape didnt look at him again at last desserts too disappeared professor dumbledore got his feet again hall fell silent ahem  just few more words now that we are all fed watered i have few start term notices give you first years should note that forest on grounds is forbidden all pupils few our older students would do well remember that as well dumbledore s twinkling eyes flashed direction weasley twins i have also been asked by mr filch caretaker remind you all that no magic should be used between classes corridors quidditch trials will be held second week term anyone interested playing for their house teams should contact madam hooch finally i must tell you that this year third  floor corridor on right hand side is out bounds everyone who does not wish die very painful death laughed but one few who did hes not serious muttered percy must be said percy frowning at dumbledore its odd because usually gives us reason why were not allowed go somewhere  forests full dangerous beasts everyone knows that i do think might have told us prefects at least now before we go bed let us sing school song cried dumbledore noticed that other teachers smiles had become rather fixed dumbledore gave his wand little flick as if trying get fly off end long golden ribbon flew out which rose high above tables twisted itself snakelike into words everyone pick their favorite tune said dumbledore off we go school bellowed hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts teach us something please whether we be old bald or young with scabby knees our heads could do with filling with some interesting stuff for now theyre bare full air dead flies bits fluff so teach us things worth knowing bring back what weve forgot just do your best well do rest learn until our brains all rot everybody finished song at different times at last only weasley twins were left singing along very slow funeral march dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand when they had finished one those who clapped loudest ah music said wiping his eyes magic beyond all we do here now bedtime off you trot gryffindor first years followed percy through chattering crowds out great hall up marble staircase harrys legs were like lead again but only because so tired full food too sleepy even be surprised that people portraits along corridors whispered pointed as they passed or that twice percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels hanging tapestries they climbed more staircases yawning dragging their feet just wondering how much farther they had go when they came sudden halt bundle walking sticks floating midair ahead them as percy took step toward them they started throwing themselves at him peeves percy whispered first years poltergeist raised his voice peeves  show yourself loud rude sound like air being let out balloon answered do you want me go bloody baron there pop little man with wicked dark eyes wide mouth appeared floating cross  legged air clutching walking sticks oooooooh said with an evil cackle ickle firsties what fun swooped suddenly at them they all ducked go away peeves or baronll hear about this i mean barked percy peeves stuck out his tongue vanished dropping walking sticks on nevilles head they heard him zooming away rattling coats armor as passed you want watch out for peeves said percy as they set off again bloody barons only one who can control him wont even listen us prefects here we are at very end corridor hung portrait very fat woman pink silk dress password she said caput draconis said percy portrait swung forward reveal round hole wall they all scrambled through  neville needed leg up  found themselves gryffindor common room cozy round room full squashy armchairs percy directed girls through one door their dormitory boys through another at top spiral staircase  they were obviously one towers  they found their beds at last five four  posters hung with deep red velvet curtains their trunks had already been brought up too tired talk much they pulled on their pajamas fell into bed great food isnt ron muttered through hangings get off scabbers hes chewing my sheets going ask ron if hed had any treacle tart but fell asleep almost at once perhaps had eaten bit too much because had very strange dream wearing professor quirrells turban which kept talking him telling him must transfer slytherin at once because his destiny told turban didnt want be slytherin got heavier heavier tried pull off but tightened painfully  there malfoy laughing at him as struggled with  then malfoy turned into hook nosed teacher snape whose laugh became high cold  there burst green light woke sweating shaking rolled over fell asleep again when woke next day didnt remember dream at all potions master there look where next tall kid with red hair wearing glasses did you see his face did you see his scar whispers followed from moment left his dormitory next day people lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe get look at him or doubled back pass him corridors again staring wished they wouldnt because trying concentrate on finding his way classes there were hundred forty two staircases at hogwarts wide sweeping ones narrow rickety ones some that led somewhere different on friday some with vanishing step halfway up that you had remember jump then there were doors that wouldnt open unless you asked politely or tickled them exactly right place doors that werent really doors at all but solid walls just pretending also very hard remember where anything because all seemed move around lot people portraits kept going visit each other sure coats armor could walk ghosts didnt help either always nasty shock when one them glided suddenly through door you were trying open nearly headless nick always happy point new gryffindors right direction but peeves poltergeist worth two locked doors trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class would drop wastepaper baskets on your head pull rugs from under your feet pelt you with bits chalk or sneak up behind you invisible grab your nose screech got your conk even worse than peeves if that possible caretaker argus filch ron managed get on wrong side him on their very first morning filch found them trying force their way through door that unluckily turned out be entrance out bounds corridor on third floor wouldnt believe they were lost sure they were trying break into on purpose threatening lock them dungeons when they were rescued by professor quirrell who passing filch owned cat called mrs norris scrawny dust  colored creature with bulging lamplike eyes just like filchs she patrolled corridors alone break rule front her put just one toe out line shed whisk off for filch whod appear wheezing two seconds later filch knew secret passageways school better than anyone except perhaps weasley twins could pop up as suddenly as any ghosts students all hated him dearest ambition many give mrs norris good kick then once you had managed find them there were classes themselves there lot more magic as quickly found out than waving your wand saying few funny words they had study night skies through their telescopes every wednesday at midnight learn names different stars movements planets three times week they went out greenhouses behind castle study herbology with dumpy little witch called professor sprout where they learned how take care all strange plants fungi found out what they were used for easily most boring class history magic which only one taught by ghost professor binns had been very old indeed when had fallen asleep front staff room fire got up next morning teach leaving his body behind him binns droned on on while they scribbled down names dates got emeric evil uric oddball mixed up professor flitwick charms teacher tiny little wizard who had stand on pile books see over his desk at start their first class took roll call when reached harrys name gave an excited squeak toppled out sight professor mcgonagall again different had been quite right think she wasnt teacher cross strict clever she gave them talking  moment they sat down her first class transfiguration is some most complex dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts she said anyone messing around my class will leave not come back you have been warned then she changed her desk into pig back again they were all very impressed couldnt wait get started but soon realized they werent going be changing furniture into animals for long time after taking lot complicated notes they were each given match started trying turn into needle by end lesson only hermione granger had made any difference her match professor mcgonagall showed class how had gone all silver pointy gave hermione rare smile class everyone had really been looking forward defense against dark arts but quirrells lessons turned out be bit joke his classroom smelled strongly garlic which everyone said ward off vampire hed met romania afraid would be coming back get him one these days his turban told them had been given him by an african prince as thank you for getting rid troublesome zombie but they werent sure they believed this story for one thing when seamus finnigan asked eagerly hear how quirrell had fought off zombie quirrell went pink started talking about weather for another they had noticed that funny smell hung around turban weasley twins insisted that stuffed full garlic as well so that quirrell protected wherever went very relieved find out that wasnt miles behind everyone else lots people had come from muggle families like him hadnt had any idea that they were witches wizards there so much learn that even people like ron didnt have much head start friday an important day for ron they finally managed find their way down great hall for breakfast without getting lost once what have we got today asked ron as poured sugar on his porridge double potions with slytherins said ron snapes head slytherin house they say always favors them  well be able see if its true wish mcgonagall favored us said professor mcgonagall head gryffindor house but hadnt stopped her from giving them huge pile homework day before just then mail arrived had gotten used this by now but had given him bit shock on first morning when about hundred owls had suddenly streamed into great hall during breakfast circling tables until they saw their owners dropping letters packages onto their laps hedwig hadnt brought anything so far she sometimes flew nibble his ear have bit toast before going off sleep owlery with other school owls this morning however she fluttered down between marmalade sugar bowl dropped note onto harrys plate tore open at once said very untidy scrawl dear i know you get friday afternoons off so would you like come have cup tea with me around three i want hear all about your first week send us an answer back with hedwig hagrid borrowed rons quill scribbled yes please see you later on back note sent hedwig off again lucky that had tea with hagrid look forward because potions lesson turned out be worst thing that had happened him so far at start term banquet had gotten idea that professor snape disliked him by end first potions lesson knew hed been wrong snape didnt dislike  hated him potions lessons took place down one dungeons colder here than up main castle would have been quite creepy enough without pickled animals floating glass jars all around walls snape like flitwick started class by taking roll call like flitwick paused at harrys name ah yes said softly potter our new  celebrity draco malfoy his friends crabbe goyle sniggered behind their hands snape finished calling names looked up at class his eyes were black like hagrid s but they had none hagrid s warmth they were cold empty made you think dark tunnels you are here learn subtle science exact art potion making began spoke barely more than whisper but they caught every word  like professor mcgonagall snape had gift keeping class silent without effort as there is little foolish wand  waving here many you will hardly believe this is magic i dont expect you will really understand beauty softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes delicate power liquids that creep through human veins bewitching mind ensnaring senses  i can teach you how bottle fame brew glory even stopper death  if you arent as big bunch dunderheads as i usually have teach more silence followed this little speech ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows hermione granger on edge her seat looked desperate start proving that she wasnt dunderhead potter said snape suddenly what would i get if i added powdered root asphodel an infusion wormwood powdered root what an infusion what glanced at ron who looked as stumped as hermione s hand had shot into air i dont know sir said snape s lips curled into sneer tut tut  fame clearly isnt everything ignored hermione s hand lets try again potter where would you look if i told you find me bezoar hermione stretched her hand as high into air as would go without her leaving her seat but didnt have faintest idea what bezoar tried not look at malfoy crabbe goyle who were shaking with laughter i dont know sir thought you wouldnt open book before coming eh potter forced himself keep looking straight into those cold eyes had looked through his books at dursleys but did snape expect him remember everything one thousand magical herbs fungi  snape still ignoring hermiones quivering hand what is difference potter between monkshood wolfsbane at this hermione stood up her hand stretching toward dungeon ceiling i dont know said quietly i think hermione does though why dont you try her few people laughed caught seamuss eye seamus winked snape however not pleased sit down snapped at hermione for your information potter asphodel wormwood make sleeping potion so powerful is known as draught living death bezoar is stone taken from stomach goat will save you from most poisons as for monkshood wolfsbane they are same plant which also goes by name aconite well why arent you all copying that down there sudden rummaging for quills parchment over noise snape said point will be taken from gryffindor house for your cheek potter things didnt improve for gryffindors as potions lesson continued snape put them all into pairs set them mixing up simple potion cure boils swept around his long black cloak watching them weigh dried nettles crush snake fangs criticizing almost everyone except malfoy whom seemed like just telling everyone look at perfect way malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds acid green smoke loud hissing filled dungeon neville had somehow managed melt seamuss cauldron into twisted blob their potion seeping across stone floor burning holes peoples shoes within seconds whole class standing on their stools while neville who had been drenched potion when cauldron collapsed moaned pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms legs idiot boy snarled snape clearing spilled potion away with one wave his wand i suppose you added porcupine quills before taking cauldron off fire neville whimpered as boils started pop up all over his nose take him up hospital wing snape spat at seamus then rounded on ron who had been working next neville you  potter  why didnt you tell him not add quills thought hed make you look good if got wrong did you thats another point youve lost for gryffindor this so unfair that opened his mouth argue but ron kicked him behind their cauldron dont push muttered ive heard snape can turn very nasty as they climbed steps out dungeon an hour later harrys mind racing his spirits were low hed lost two points for gryffindor his very first week  why did snape hate him so much cheer up said ron snapes always taking points off fred george can i come meet hagrid with you at five three they left castle made their way across grounds hagrid lived small wooden house on edge forbidden forest crossbow pair galoshes were outside front door when knocked they heard frantic scrabbling from inside several booming barks then hagrid s voice rang out saying back fang  back hagrid s big hairy face appeared crack as pulled door open hang on said back fang let them struggling keep hold on collar an enormous black boarhound there only one room inside hams pheasants were hanging from ceiling copper kettle boiling on open fire corner stood massive bed with patchwork quilt over make yerselves at home said hagrid letting go fang who bounded straight at ron started licking his ears like hagrid fang clearly not as fierce as looked this is ron told hagrid who pouring boiling water into large teapot putting rock cakes onto plate another weasley eh said hagrid glancing at rons freckles i spent half me life chasin yer twin brothers away from forest rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth but ron pretended be enjoying them as they told hagrid all about their first lessons fang rested his head on harrys knee drooled all over his robes ron were delighted hear hagrid call filch that old git an as fer that cat mrs norris id like ter introduce her fang sometime dyeh know every time i go up ter school she follows me everywhere cant get rid her  filch puts her up told hagrid about snapes lesson hagrid like ron told not worry about that snape liked hardly any students but seemed really hate me rubbish said hagrid why should yet couldnt help thinking that hagrid didnt quite meet his eyes when said that hows yer brother charlie hagrid asked ron i liked him lot  great with animals wondered if hagrid had changed subject on purpose while ron told hagrid all about charlies work with dragons picked up piece paper that lying on table under tea cozy cutting from daily prophet  gringotts break latest investigations continue into break at gringotts on   july widely believed be work dark wizards or witches unknown gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken vault that searched had fact been emptied same day but were not telling you what there so keep your noses out if you know whats good for you said gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon remembered ron telling him on train that someone had tried rob gringotts but ron hadnt mentioned date hagrid said that gringotts break happened on my birthday mightve been happening while we were there there no doubt about hagrid definitely didnt meet harrys eyes this time grunted offered him another rock cake read story again vault that searched had fact been emptied earlier that same day hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred thirteen if you could call emptying taking out that grubby little package had that been what thieves were looking for as ron walked back castle for dinner their pockets weighed down with rock cakes theyd been too polite refuse thought that none lessons hed had so far had given him as much think about as tea with hagrid had hagrid collected that package just time where now did hagrid know something about snape that didnt want tell 9 midnight duel had never believed would meet boy hated more than dudley but that before met draco malfoy still first year gryffindors only had potions with slytherins so they didnt have put up with malfoy much or at least they didnt until they spotted notice pinned up gryffindor common room that made them all groan flying lessons would be starting on thursday  gryffindor slytherin would be learning together typical said darkly just what i always wanted make fool myself on broomstick front malfoy had been looking forward learning fly more than anything else you dont know that youll make fool yourself said ron reasonably anyway i know malfoys always going on about how good is at quidditch but i bet thats all talk malfoy certainly did talk about flying lot complained loudly about first years never getting on house quidditch teams told long boastful stories that always seemed end with him narrowly escaping muggles helicopters wasnt only one though way seamus finnigan told hed spent most his childhood zooming around countryside on his broomstick even ron would tell anyone whod listen about time hed almost hit hang glider on charlies old broom everyone from wizarding families talked about quidditch constantly ron had already had big argument with dean thomas who shared their dormitory about soccer ron couldnt see what exciting about game with only one ball where no one allowed fly had caught ron prodding deans poster west ham soccer team trying make players move neville had never been on broomstick his life because his grandmother had never let him near one privately felt shed had good reason because neville managed have an extraordinary number accidents even with both feet on ground hermione granger almost as nervous about flying as neville this something you couldnt learn by heart out book  not that she hadnt tried at breakfast on thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips shed gotten out library book called quidditch through ages neville hanging on her every word desperate for anything that might help him hang on his broomstick later but everybody else very pleased when hermione s lecture interrupted by arrival mail hadnt had single letter since hagrids note something that malfoy had been quick notice course malfoy s eagle owl always bringing him packages sweets from home which opened gloatingly at slytherin table barn owl brought neville small package from his grandmother opened excitedly showed them glass ball size large marble which seemed be full white smoke its remembrall explained gran knows i forget things  this tells you if theres something youve forgotten do look you hold tight like this if turns red  oh  his face fell because remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet  youve forgotten something  neville trying remember what hed forgotten when draco malfoy who passing gryffindor table snatched remembrall out his hand ron jumped their feet they were half hoping for reason fight malfoy but professor mcgonagall who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher school there flash whats going on malfoys got my remembrall professor scowling malfoy quickly dropped remembrall back on table just looking said sloped away with crabbe goyle behind him at three thirty that afternoon ron other gryffindors hurried down front steps onto grounds for their first flying lesson clear breezy day grass rippled under their feet as they marched down sloping lawns toward smooth flat lawn on opposite side grounds forbidden forest whose trees were swaying darkly distance slytherins were already there so were twenty broomsticks lying neat lines on ground had heard fred george weasley complain about school brooms saying that some them started vibrate if you flew too high or always flew slightly left their teacher madam hooch arrived she had short gray hair yellow eyes like hawk well what are you all waiting for she barked everyone stand by broomstick come on hurry up  glanced down at his broom old some twigs stuck out at odd angles stick out your right hand over your broom called madam hooch at front say up  up everyone shouted harrys broom jumped into his hand at once but one few that did hermione grangers had simply rolled over on ground nevilles hadnt moved at all perhaps brooms like horses could tell when you were afraid thought there quaver nevilles voice that said only too clearly that wanted keep his feet on ground madam hooch then showed them how mount their brooms without sliding off end walked up down rows correcting their grips ron were delighted when she told malfoy hed been doing wrong for years now when i blow my whistle you kick off from ground hard said madam hooch keep your brooms steady rise few feet then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly on my whistle  three  two   but neville nervous jumpy frightened being left on ground pushed off hard before whistle had touched madam hoochs lips come back boy she shouted but neville rising straight up like cork shot out bottle  twelve feet  twenty feet saw his scared white face look down at ground falling away saw him gasp slip sideways off broom  wham  thud nasty crack neville lay facedown on grass heap his broomstick still rising higher higher started drift lazily toward forbidden forest out sight madam hooch bending over neville her face as white as his broken wrist heard her mutter come on boy  its all right up you get she turned rest class none you is move while i take this boy hospital wing you leave those brooms where they are or youll be out hogwarts before you can say quidditch come on dear neville his face tear streaked clutching his wrist hobbled off with madam hooch who had her arm around him no sooner were they out earshot than malfoy burst into laughter did you see his face great lump other slytherins joined shut up malfoy snapped parvati patil ooh sticking up for longbottom said pansy parkinson hard faced slytherin girl never thought youd like fat little crybabies parvati look said malfoy darting forward snatching something out grass its that stupid thing longbottoms gran sent him remembrall glittered sun as held up give that here malfoy said quietly everyone stopped talking watch malfoy smiled nastily i think ill leave somewhere for longbottom find  how about  up tree give here yelled but malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick taken off hadnt been lying could fly well hovering level with topmost branches an oak called come get potter grabbed his broom ivo shouted hermione granger madam hooch told us not move  youll get us all into trouble ignored her blood pounding his ears mounted broom kicked hard against ground up up soared air rushed through his hair his robes whipped out behind him  rush fierce joy realized hed found something could do without being taught  this easy this wonderful pulled his broomstick up little take even higher heard screams gasps girls back on ground an admiring whoop from ron turned his broomstick sharply face malfoy midair malfoy looked stunned give here called or ill knock you off that broom oh yeah said malfoy trying sneer but looking worried knew somehow what do leaned forward grasped broom tightly both hands shot toward malfoy like javelin malfoy only just got out way time made sharp about  face held broom steady few people below were clapping no crabbe goyle up here save your neck malfoy called same thought seemed have struck malfoy catch if you can then shouted threw glass ball high into air streaked back toward ground saw as though slow motion ball rise up air then start fall leaned forward pointed his broom handle down  next second gathering speed steep dive racing ball  wind whistled his ears mingled with screams people watching  stretched out his hand  foot from ground caught just time pull his broom straight toppled gently onto grass with remembrall clutched safely his fist potter his heart sank faster than hed just dived professor mcgonagall running toward them got his feet trembling never  all my time at hogwarts   professor mcgonagall almost speechless with shock her glasses flashed furiously   how dare you  might have broken your neck   wasnt his fault professor   be quiet miss patil   but malfoy   thats enough mr weasley potter follow me now caught sight malfoy crabbe goyles triumphant faces as left walking numbly professor mcgonagalls wake as she strode toward castle going be expelled just knew wanted say something defend himself but there seemed be something wrong with his voice professor mcgonagall sweeping along without even looking at him had jog keep up now hed done hadnt even lasted two weeks hed be packing his bags ten minutes what would dursleys say when turned up on doorstep up front steps up marble staircase inside still professor mcgonagall didnt say word him she wrenched open doors marched along corridors with trotting miserably behind her maybe she taking him dumbledore thought hagrid expelled but allowed stay on as gamekeeper perhaps could be hagrids assistant his stomach twisted as imagined watching ron others becoming wizards while stumped around grounds carrying hagrids bag professor mcgonagall stopped outside classroom she opened door poked her head inside excuse me professor flitwick could i borrow wood for moment wood thought bewildered wood cane she going use on him but wood turned out be person burly fifth year boy who came out flitwicks class looking confused follow me you two said professor mcgonagall they marched on up corridor wood looking curiously at here professor mcgonagall pointed them into classroom that empty except for peeves who busy writing rude words on blackboard out peeves she barked peeves threw chalk into bin which clanged loudly swooped out cursing professor mcgonagall slammed door behind him turned face two boys potter this is oliver wood wood  ive found you seeker woods expression changed from puzzlement delight are you serious professor absolutely said professor mcgonagall crisply boys natural ive never seen anything like that your first time on broomstick potter nodded silently didnt have clue what going on but didnt seem be being expelled some feeling started coming back his legs caught that thing his hand after fifty foot dive professor mcgonagall told wood didnt even scratch himself charlie weasley couldnt have done wood now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once ever seen game quidditch potter asked excitedly woods captain gryffindor team professor mcgonagall explained hes just build for seeker too said wood now walking around staring at him light  speedy  well have get him decent broom professor  nimbus two thousand or cleansweep seven id say i shall speak professor dumbledore see if we cant bend first year rule heaven knows we need better team than last year flattened that last match by slytherin i couldnt look severus snape face for weeks  professor mcgonagall peered sternly over her glasses at i want hear youre training hard potter or i may change my mind about punishing you then she suddenly smiled your father would have been proud she said an excellent quidditch player himself youre joking dinnertime had just finished telling ron what had happened when hed left grounds with professor mcgonagall ron had piece steak kidney pie halfway his mouth but hed forgotten all about seeker said but first years never  you must be youngest house player about     century said shoveling pie into his mouth felt particularly hungry after excitement afternoon wood told me ron so amazed so impressed just sat gaped at i start training next week said only dont tell anyone wood wants keep secret fred george weasley now came into hall spotted hurried over well done said george low voice wood told us were on team too  beaters i tell you were going win that quidditch cup for sure this year said

out school bet its that one behind statue gregory smarmy that we found our first week see you fred george had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up malfoy flanked by crabbe goyle having last meal potter when are you getting train back muggles youre lot braver now that youre back on ground youve got your little friends with you said coolly there course nothing at all little about crabbe goyle but as high table full teachers neither them could do more than crack their knuckles scowl id take you on anytime on my own said malfoy tonight if you want wizards duel wands only  no contact whats matter never heard wizards duel before i suppose course has said ron wheeling around im his second whos yours malfoy looked at crabbe goyle sizing them up crabbe said midnight all right well meet you trophy room thats always unlocked when malfoy had gone ron looked at each other what is wizards duel said what do you mean youre my second well seconds there take over if you die said ron casually getting started at last on his cold pie catching look on harrys face added quickly but people only die proper duels you know with real wizards most you malfoyll be able do is send sparks at each other neither you knows enough magic do any real damage i bet expected you refuse anyway what if i wave my wand nothing happens throw away punch him on nose ron suggested excuse me they both looked up hermione granger cant person eat peace this place said ron hermione ignored him spoke i couldnt help overhearing what you malfoy were saying   bet you could ron muttered   you mustnt go wandering around school at night think points youll lose gryffindor if youre caught youre bound be its really very selfish you its really none your business said good bye said ron all same wasnt what youd call perfect end day thought as lay awake much later listening dean seamus falling asleep neville wasnt back from hospital wing ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as if tries curse you youd better dodge because i cant remember how block them there very good chance they were going get caught by filch or mrs norris felt pushing his luck breaking another school rule today on other hand malfoys sneering face kept looming up out darkness  this his big chance beat malfoy face face couldnt miss half past eleven ron muttered at last wed better go they pulled on their bathrobes picked up their wands crept across tower room down spiral staircase into gryffindor common room few embers were still glowing fireplace turning all armchairs into hunched black shadows they had almost reached portrait hole when voice spoke from chair nearest them i cant believe youre going do this lamp flickered on hermione granger wearing pink bathrobe frown you said ron furiously go back bed i almost told your brother hermione snapped percy  hes prefect hed put stop this couldnt believe anyone could be so interfering come on said ron pushed open portrait fat lady climbed through hole hermione wasnt going give up that easily she followed ron through portrait hole hissing at them like an angry goose dont you care about gryffindor do you only care about yourselves  dont want slytherin win house cup youll lose all points i got from professor mcgonagall for knowing about switching spells go away all right but i warned you you just remember what i said when youre on train

caught ill never rest until ive learned that curse bogies quirrell told us about used on you hermione opened her mouth perhaps tell ron exactly how use curse bogies but hissed at her be quiet beckoned them all forward they flitted along corridors striped with bars moonlight from high windows at every turn expected run into filch or mrs norris but they were lucky they sped up staircase third floor tiptoed toward trophy room malfoy crabbe werent there yet crystal trophy cases glimmered where moonlight caught them cups shields plates statues winked silver gold darkness they edged along walls keeping their eyes on doors at either end room took out his wand case malfoy leapt started at once minutes crept by hes late maybe hes chickened out ron whispered then noise next room made them jump had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak  wasnt malfoy sniff around my sweet they might be lurking corner filch speaking mrs norris horror struck waved madly at other three follow him as quickly as possible they scurried silently toward door away from filchs voice nevilles robes had barely whipped round corner when they heard filch enter trophy room theyre here somewhere they heard him mutter probably hiding this way mouthed others petrified they began creep down long gallery full suits armor they could hear filch getting nearer neville suddenly let out frightened squeak broke into run  tripped grabbed ron around waist pair them toppled right into suit armor clanging crashing were enough wake whole castle run yelled four them sprinted down gallery not looking back see whether filch following  they swung around doorpost galloped down one corridor then another lead without any idea where they were or where they were going  they ripped through tapestry found themselves hidden passageway hurtled along came out near their charms classroom which they knew miles from trophy room i think weve lost him panted leaning against cold wall wiping his forehead neville bent double wheezing spluttering i  told  you hermione gasped clutching at stitch her chest i  told  you weve got get back gryffindor tower said ron quickly as possible malfoy tricked you hermione said you realize that dont you never going meet you  filch knew someone going be trophy room malfoy must have tipped him off thought she probably right but wasnt going tell her that lets go wasnt going be that simple they hadnt gone more than dozen paces when doorknob rattled something came shooting out classroom front them peeves caught sight them gave squeal delight shut up peeves  please  youll get us thrown out peeves cackled wandering around at midnight ickle firsties tut tut tut naughty naughty youll get caughty not if you dont give us away peeves please should tell filch i should said peeves sanity voice but his eyes glittered wickedly its for your own good you know get out way snapped ron taking swipe at peeves  this big mistake students out bed peeves bellowed students out bed down charms corridor ducking under peeves they ran for their lives right end corridor where they slammed into door  locked this is ron moaned as they pushed helplessly at door were done for this is end they could hear footsteps filch running as fast as could toward peeves s shouts oh move over hermione snarled she grabbed harrys wand tapped lock whispered alohomora lock clicked door swung open  they piled through shut quickly pressed their ears against listening which way did they go peeves filch saying quick tell me say please  dont mess with me peeves now where did they go shant say nothing if you dont say please said peeves his annoying singsong voice all right  please nothing ha haaa told you i wouldnt say nothing if you didnt say please ha ha haaaaaa they heard sound peeves whooshing away filch cursing rage thinks this door is locked whispered i think well be okay  get off neville for neville had been tugging on sleeve harrys bathrobe for last minute what turned around  saw quite clearly what for moment sure hed walked into nightmare  this too much on top everything that had happened so far they werent room as had supposed they were corridor forbidden corridor on third floor now they knew why forbidden they were looking straight into eyes monstrous dog dog that filled whole space between ceiling floor had three heads three pairs rolling mad eyes three noses twitching quivering their direction three drooling mouths saliva hanging slippery ropes from yellowish fangs standing quite still all six eyes staring at them knew that only reason they werent already dead that their sudden appearance had taken by surprise but quickly getting over that there no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant groped for doorknob  between filch death hed take filch they fell backward  slammed door shut they ran they almost flew back down corridor filch must have hurried off look for them somewhere else because they didnt see him anywhere but they hardly cared  all they wanted do put as much space as possible between them that monster they didnt stop running until they reached portrait fat lady on seventh floor where on earth have you all been she asked looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders their flushed sweaty faces never mind that  pig snout pig snout panted portrait swung forward they scrambled into common room collapsed trembling into armchairs while before any them said anything neville indeed looked as if hed never speak again what do they think theyre doing keeping thing like that locked up school said ron finally if any dog needs exercise that one does hermione had got both her breath her bad temper back again you dont use your eyes any you do you she snapped didnt you see what standing on floor suggested i wasnt looking at its feet i too busy with its heads no not floor standing on trapdoor its obviously guarding something she stood up glaring at them i hope youre pleased with yourselves we could all have been killed  or worse expelled now if you dont mind im going bed ron stared after her his mouth open no we dont mind said youd think we dragged her along wouldnt you but hermione had given something else think about as climbed back into bed dog guarding something    what had hagrid said gringotts safest place world for something you wanted hide  except perhaps hogwarts looked as though had found out where grubby little package from vault seven hundred thirteen 0 halloween malfoy couldnt believe his eyes when saw that ron were still at hogwarts next day looking tired but perfectly cheerful indeed by next morning ron thought that meeting three headed dog had been an excellent adventure they were quite keen have another one meantime filled ron about package that seemed have been moved from gringotts hogwarts they spent lot time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection its either really valuable or really dangerous said ron or both said but as all they knew for sure about mysterious object that about two inches long they didnt have much chance guessing what without further clues neither neville nor hermione showed slightest interest what lay underneath dog trapdoor all neville cared about never going near dog again hermione now refusing speak ron but she such bossy know all that they saw this as an added bonus all they really wanted now way getting back at malfoy their great delight just such thing arrived mail about week later as owls flooded into great hall as usual everyones attention caught at once by long thin package carried by six large screech owls just as interested as everyone else see what this large parcel amazed when owls soared down dropped right front him knocking his bacon floor they had hardly fluttered out way when another owl dropped letter on top parcel ripped open letter first which lucky because said do not open parcel at table contains your new nimbus two thousand but i dont want everybody knowing youve got broomstick or theyll all want one oliver wood will meet you tonight on quidditch field at seven oclock for your first training session professor m mcgonagall had difficulty hiding his glee as handed note ron read nimbus two thousand ron moaned enviously ive never even touched one they left hall quickly wanting unwrap broomstick private before their first class but halfway across entrance hall they found way upstairs barred by crabbe goyle malfoy seized package from felt thats broomstick said throwing back with mixture jealousy spite on his face youll be for this time potter first years arent allowed them ron couldnt resist its not any old broomstick said its nimbus two thousand what did you say youve got at home malfoy comet two sixty ron grinned at comets look flashy but theyre not same league as nimbus what would you know about weasley you couldnt afford half handle malfoy snapped back i suppose you your brothers have save up twig by twig before ron could answer professor flitwick appeared at malfoys elbow not arguing i hope boys squeaked potters been sent broomstick professor said malfoy quickly yes yes thats right said professor flitwick beaming at professor mcgonagall told me all about special circumstances potter what model is nimbus two thousand sir said fighting not laugh at look horror on malfoys face its really thanks malfoy here that ive got added ron headed upstairs smothering their laughter at malfoys obvious rage confusion well its true chortled as they reached top marble staircase if hadnt stolen nevilles remembrall i wouldnt be on team  so i suppose you think thats reward for breaking rules came an angry voice from just behind them hermione stomping up stairs looking disapprovingly at package harrys hand i thought you werent speaking us said yes dont stop now said ron its doing us so much good hermione marched away with her nose air had lot trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day kept wandering up dormitory where his new broomstick lying under his bed or straying off quidditch field where hed be learning play that night bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what eating then rushed upstairs with ron unwrap nimbus two thousand at last wow ron sighed as broomstick rolled onto harrys bedspread even who knew nothing about different brooms thought looked wonderful sleek shiny with mahogany handle had long tail neat straight twigs nimbus two thousand written gold near top as seven oclock drew nearer left castle set off dusk toward quidditch field hed never been inside stadium before hundreds seats were raised stands around field so that spectators were high enough see what going on at either end field were three golden poles with hoops on end they reminded little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles through except that they were fifty feet high too eager fly again wait for wood mounted his broomstick kicked off from ground what feeling  swooped out goal posts then sped up down field nimbus two thousand turned wherever wanted at his lightest touch hey potter come down oliver wood had arrived carrying large wooden crate under his arm landed next him very nice said wood his eyes glinting i see what mcgonagall meant  you really are natural im just going teach you rules this evening then youll be joining team practice three times week opened crate inside were four different sized balls right said wood now quidditch is easy enough understand even if its not too easy play there are seven players on each side three them are called chasers three chasers repeated as wood took out bright red ball about size soccer ball this balls called quaffle said wood chasers throw quaffle each other try get through one hoops score goal ten points every time quaffle goes through one hoops follow me chasers throw quaffle put through hoops score recited so  thats sort like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops isnt whats basketball said wood curiously never mind said quickly now theres another player on each side whos called keeper  im keeper for gryffindor i have fly around our hoops stop other team from scoring three chasers one keeper said who determined remember all they play with quaffle okay got that so what are they for pointed at three balls left inside box ill show you now said wood take this handed small club bit like short baseball bat im going show you what bludgers do wood said these two are bludgers showed two identical balls jet black slightly smaller than red quaffle noticed that they seemed be straining escape straps holding them inside box stand back wood warned bent down freed one bludgers at once black ball rose high air then pelted straight at harrys face swung at with bat stop from breaking his nose sent zigzagging away into air  zoomed around their heads then shot at wood who dived on top managed pin ground see wood panted forcing struggling bludger back into crate strapping down safely bludgers rocket around trying knock players off their brooms thats why you have two beaters on each team  weasley twins are ours  its their job protect their side from bludgers try knock them toward other team so  think youve got all that three chasers try score with quaffle keeper guards goal posts beaters keep bludgers away from their team reeled off very good said wood er  have bludgers ever killed anyone asked hoping sounded offhand never at hogwarts weve had couple broken jaws but nothing worse than that now last member team is seeker thats you you dont have worry about quaffle or bludgers     unless they crack my head open dont worry weasleys are more than match for bludgers  i mean theyre like pair human bludgers themselves wood reached into crate took out fourth last ball compared with quaffle bludgers tiny about size large walnut bright gold had little fluttering silver wings this said wood is golden snitch its most important ball lot its very hard catch because its so fast difficult see its seekers job catch youve got weave out chasers beaters bludgers quaffle get before other teams seeker because whichever seeker catches snitch wins his team an extra hundred fifty points so they nearly always win thats why seekers get fouled so much game quidditch only ends when snitch is caught so can go on for ages  i think record is three months they had keep bringing on substitutes so players could get some sleep well thats  any questions shook his head understood what had do all right doing that going be problem we wont practice with snitch yet said wood carefully shutting back inside crate its too dark we might lose lets try you out with few these pulled bag ordinary golf balls out his pocket few minutes later were up air wood throwing golf balls as hard as could every direction for catch didnt miss single one wood delighted after half an hour night had really fallen they couldnt carry on that quidditch cupll have our name on this year said wood happily as they trudged back up castle i wouldnt be surprised if you turn out better than charlie weasley could have played for england if hadnt gone off chasing dragons perhaps because now so busy what with quidditch practice three evenings week on top all his homework but could hardly believe when realized that hed already been at hogwarts two months castle felt more like home than privet drive ever had his lessons too were becoming more more interesting now that they had mastered basics on halloween morning they woke delicious smell baking pumpkin wafting through corridors even better professor flitwick announced charms that thought they were ready start making objects fly something they had all been dying try since theyd seen him make nevilles toad zoom around classroom professor flitwick put class into pairs practice harrys partner seamus finnigan which relief because neville had been trying catch his eye ron however be working with hermione granger hard tell whether ron or hermione angrier about this she hadnt spoken either them since day harrys broomstick had arrived now dont forget that nice wrist movement weve been practicing squeaked professor flitwick perched on top his pile books as usual swish flick remember swish flick saying magic words properly is very important too  never forget wizard baruffio who said s instead f found himself on floor with buffalo on his chest very difficult seamus swished flicked but feather they were supposed be sending skyward just lay on desktop seamus got so impatient that prodded with his wand set fire  had put out with his hat ron at next table wasnt having much more luck wingardium leviosal shouted waving his long arms like windmill youre saying wrong heard hermione snap its wing gar dium levi o sa make gar nice long you do then if youre so clever ron snarled hermione rolled up sleeves her gown flicked her wand said wingardium leviosav their feather rose off desk hovered about four feet above their heads oh well done cried professor flitwick clapping everyone see here miss grangers done ron very bad mood by end class its no wonder no one can stand her said as they pushed their way into crowded corridor shes nightmare honestly someone knocked into as they hurried past him hermione caught glimpse her face  startled see that she tears i think she heard you so said ron but looked bit uncomfortable she mustve noticed shes got no friends hermione didnt turn up for next class wasnt seen all afternoon on their way down great hall for halloween feast ron overheard parvati patil telling her friend lavender that hermione crying girls bathroom wanted be left alone ron looked still more awkward at this but moment later they had entered great hall where halloween decorations put hermione out their minds thousand live bats fluttered from walls ceiling while thousand more swooped over tables low black clouds making candles pumpkins stutter feast appeared suddenly on golden plates as had at start term banquet just helping himself baked potato when professor quirrell came sprinting into hall his turban askew terror on his face everyone stared as reached professor dumbledores chair slumped against table gasped troll  dungeons  thought you ought know then sank floor dead faint there an uproar took several purple firecrackers exploding from end professor dumbledores wand bring silence prefects rumbled lead your houses back dormitories immediately percy his element follow me stick together first years no need fear troll if you follow my orders stay close behind me now make way first years coming through excuse me im prefect how could troll get asked as they climbed stairs dont ask me theyre supposed be really stupid said ron maybe peeves let for halloween joke they passed different groups people hurrying different directions as they jostled their way through crowd confused hufflepuffs suddenly grabbed rons arm ive just thought  hermione what about her she doesnt know about troll ron bit his lip oh all right snapped but percyd better not see us ducking down they joined hufflepuffs going other way slipped down deserted side corridor hurried off toward girls bathroom they had just turned corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them percy hissed ron pulling behind large stone griffin peering around however they saw not percy but snape crossed corridor disappeared from view whats doing whispered why isnt down dungeons with rest teachers search me quietly as possible they crept along next corridor after snape s fading footsteps hes heading for third floor said but ron held up his hand can you smell something sniffed foul stench reached his nostrils mixture old socks kind public toilet no one seems clean then they heard  low grunting shuffling footfalls gigantic feet ron pointed  at end passage left something huge moving toward them they shrank into shadows watched as emerged into patch moonlight horrible sight twelve feet tall its skin dull granite gray its great lumpy body like boulder with its small bald head perched on top like coconut had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat horny feet smell coming from incredible holding huge wooden club which dragged along floor because its arms were so long troll stopped next doorway peered inside waggled its long ears making up its tiny mind then slouched slowly into room keys lock muttered we could lock good idea said ron nervously they edged toward open door mouths dry praying troll wasnt about come out with one great leap managed grab key slam door lock yes flushed with their victory they started run back up passage but as they reached corner they heard something that made their hearts stop  high petrified scream  coming from chamber theyd just chained up oh no said ron pale as bloody baron its girls bathroom gasped  hermionel they said together last thing they wanted do but what choice did they have wheeling around they sprinted back door turned key fumbling their panic pulled door open they ran inside hermione granger shrinking against wall opposite looking as if she about faint troll advancing on her knocking sinks off walls as went confuse said desperately ron seizing tap threw as hard as could against wall troll stopped few feet from hermione lumbered around blinking stupidly see what had made noise its mean little eyes saw hesitated then made for him instead lifting its club as went oy pea brain yelled ron from other side chamber threw metal pipe at troll didnt even seem notice pipe hitting its shoulder but heard yell paused again turning its ugly snout toward ron instead giving time run around come on run run yelled at hermione trying pull her toward door but she couldnt move she still flat against wall her mouth open with terror shouting echoes seemed be driving troll berserk roared again started toward ron who nearest had no way escape then did something that both very brave very stupid took great running jump managed fasten his arms around trolls neck from behind troll couldnt feel hanging there but even troll will notice if you stick long bit wood up its nose harrys wand had still been his hand when hed jumped  had gone straight up one trolls nostrils howling with pain troll twisted flailed its club with clinging on for dear life any second troll going rip him off or catch him terrible blow with club hermione had sunk floor fright ron pulled out his own wand  not knowing what going do heard himself cry first spell that came into his head wingardium leviosal club flew suddenly out trolls hand rose high high up into air turned slowly over  dropped with sickening crack onto its owners head troll swayed on spot then fell flat on its face with thud that made whole room tremble got his feet shaking out breath ron standing there with his wand still raised staring at what had done hermione who spoke first is  dead i dont think so said i think its just been knocked out bent down pulled his wand out trolls nose covered what looked like lumpy gray glue urgh  troll boogers wiped on trolls trousers sudden slamming loud footsteps made three them look up they hadnt realized what racket they had been making but course someone downstairs must have heard crashes trolls roars moment later professor mcgonagall had come bursting into room closely followed by snape with quirrell bringing up rear quirrell took one look at troll let out faint whimper sat quickly down on toilet clutching his heart snape bent over troll professor mcgonagall looking at ron harry had never seen her look so angry her lips were white hopes winning fifty points for gryffindor faded quickly from harrys mind what on earth were you thinking said professor mcgonagall with cold fury her voice looked at ron who still standing with his wand air youre lucky you werent killed why arent you your dormitory snape gave swift piercing look looked at floor wished ron would put his wand down then small voice came out shadows please professor mcgonagall  they were looking for me miss granger hermione had managed get her feet at last i went looking for troll because i  i thought i could deal with on my own  you know because ive read all about them ron dropped his wand hermione granger telling downright lie teacher if they hadnt found me id be dead now stuck his wand up its nose ron knocked out with its own club they didnt have time come fetch anyone about finish me off when they arrived ron tried look as though this story wasnt new them well  that case  said professor mcgonagall staring at three them miss granger you foolish girl how could you think tackling mountain troll on your own hermione hung her head speechless hermione last person do anything against rules here she pretending she had get them out trouble as if snape had started handing out sweets miss granger five points will be taken from gryffindor for this said professor mcgonagall im very disappointed you if youre not hurt at all youd better get off gryffindor tower students are finishing feast their houses hermione left professor mcgonagall turned ron well i still say you were lucky but not many first years could have taken on full grown mountain troll you each win gryffindor five points professor dumbledore will be informed this you may go they hurried out chamber didnt speak at all until they had climbed two floors up relief be away from smell troll quite apart from anything else we should have gotten more than ten points ron grumbled five you mean once shes taken off hermione s good her get us out trouble like that ron admitted mind you we did save her she might not have needed saving if we hadnt locked thing with her reminded him they had reached portrait fat lady pig snout they said entered common room packed noisy everyone eating food that had been sent up hermione however stood alone by door waiting for them there very embarrassed pause then none them looking at each other they all said thanks hurried off get plates but from that moment on hermione granger became their friend there are some things you cant share without ending up liking each other knocking out twelve foot mountain troll is one them quidditch as they entered november weather turned very cold mountains around school became icy gray lake like chilled steel every morning ground covered frost hagrid could be seen from upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on quidditch field bundled up long moleskin overcoat rabbit fur gloves enormous beaverskin boots quidditch season had begun on saturday would be playing his first match after weeks training gryffindor versus slytherin if gryffindor won they would move up into second place house championship hardly anyone had seen play because wood had decided that as their secret weapon should be kept well secret but news that playing seeker had leaked out somehow didnt know which worse  people telling him hed be brilliant or people telling him theyd be running around underneath him holding mattress really lucky that now had hermione as friend didnt know how hed have gotten through all his homework without her what with all last  minute quidditch practice wood making them do she had also lent him quidditch through ages which turned out be very interesting read learned that there were seven hundred ways committing quidditch foul that all them had happened during world cup match  that seekers were usually smallest fastest players that most serious quidditch accidents seemed happen them that although people rarely died playing quidditch referees had been known vanish turn up months later sahara desert hermione had become bit more relaxed about breaking rules since ron had saved her from mountain troll she much nicer for day before harrys first quidditch match three them were out freezing courtyard during break she had conjured them up bright blue fire that could be carried around jam jar they were standing with their backs getting warm when snape crossed yard noticed at once that snape limping ron hermione moved closer together block fire from view they were sure wouldnt be allowed unfortunately something about their guilty faces caught snapes eye limped over hadnt seen fire but seemed be looking for reason tell them off anyway whats that youve got there potter quidditch through ages showed him library books are not be taken outside school said snape give me five points from gryffindor hes just made that rule up muttered angrily as snape limped away wonder whats wrong with his leg dunno but i hope its really hurting him said ron bitterly gryffindor common room very noisy that evening ron hermione sat together next window hermione checking rons charms homework for them she would never let them copy how will you learn but by asking her read through they got right answers anyway felt restless wanted quidditch through ages back take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow why should be afraid snape getting up told ron hermione going ask snape if could have better you than me they said together but had an idea that snape wouldnt refuse if there were other teachers listening made his way down staffroom knocked there no answer knocked again nothing perhaps snape had left book there worth try pushed door ajar peered inside  horrible scene met his eyes snape filch were inside alone snape holding his robes above his knees one his legs bloody mangled filch handing snape bandages blasted thing snape saying how are you supposed keep your eyes on all three heads at once tried shut door quietly but  potter snape s face twisted with fury as dropped his robes quickly hide his leg gulped i just wondered if i could have my book back get out out left before snape could take any more points from gryffindor sprinted back upstairs did you get ron asked as joined them whats matter low whisper told them what hed seen you know what this means finished breathlessly tried get past that three headed dog at halloween thats where going when we saw him  hes after whatever its guarding id bet my broomstick let that troll make diversion hermiones eyes were wide no  wouldnt she said i know hes not very nice but wouldnt try steal something dumbledore keeping safe honestly hermione you think all teachers are saints or something snapped ron im with i wouldnt put anything past snape but whats after whats that dog guarding went bed with his head buzzing with same question neville snoring loudly but couldnt sleep tried empty his mind  needed sleep had had his first quidditch match few hours  but expression on snapes face when had seen his leg wasnt easy forget next morning dawned very bright cold great hall full delicious smell fried sausages cheerful chatter everyone looking forward good quidditch match youve got eat some breakfast i dont want anything just bit

jordan saying chaser pucey ducks two bludgers two weasleys chaser bell speeds toward  wait moment  that snitch murmur ran through crowd as adrian pucey dropped quaffle too busy looking over his

still possession as dodged another bludger which went spinning dangerously past his head that happened his broom gave sudden frightening lurch for split second thought going fall gripped broom tightly with both his hands knees hed never felt anything like that happened again as though broom trying buck him off but nimbus two thousands did not suddenly decide buck their riders off tried turn back toward gryffindor goal posts  had half mind ask wood call time out  then realized that his broom completely out his control couldnt turn couldnt direct at all zigzagging through air every now then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him lee still commentating slytherin possession  flint with quaffle  passes spinnet  passes bell  hit hard face by bludger hope broke his nose  only joking professor  slytherins score  oh no  slytherins were cheering no one seemed have noticed that harrys broom behaving strangely carrying him slowly higher away from game jerking twitching as went dunno what thinks hes doing hagrid mumbled stared through his binoculars if i didn know better id say hed lost control his broom  but cant have  suddenly people were pointing up at all over stands his broom had started roll over over with him only just managing hold on then whole crowd gasped harrys broom had given wild jerk swung off now dangling from holding on with only one hand did something happen when flint blocked him seamus whispered cant have hagrid said his voice shaking cant nothing interfere with broomstick except powerful dark magic  no kid could do that nimbus two thousand at these words hermione seized hagrid s binoculars but instead looking up at she started looking frantically at crowd what are you doing moaned ron gray faced i knew hermione gasped snape  look ron grabbed binoculars snape middle stands opposite them had his eyes fixed on muttering nonstop under his breath hes doing something  jinxing broom said hermione what should we do leave me before ron could say another word hermione had disappeared ron turned binoculars back on his broom vibrating so hard almost impossible for him hang on much longer whole crowd on its feet watching terrified as weasleys flew up try pull safely onto one their brooms but no good  every time they got near him broom would jump higher still they dropped lower circled beneath him obviously hoping catch him if fell marcus flint seized quaffle scored five times without anyone noticing come on hermione ron muttered desperately hermione had fought her way across stand where snape stood now racing along row behind him she didnt even stop say sorry as she knocked professor quirrell headfirst into row front reaching snape she crouched down pulled out her wand whispered few well chosen words bright blue flames shot from her wand onto hem snape s robes took perhaps thirty seconds for snape realize that on fire sudden yelp told her she had done her job scooping fire off him into little jar her pocket she scrambled back along row  snape would never know what had happened enough up air suddenly able clamber back on his broom neville you can look ron said neville had been sobbing into hagrids jacket for last five minutes speeding toward ground when crowd saw him clap his hand his mouth as though about be sick  hit field on all fours  coughed  something gold fell into his hand ive got snitch shouted waving above his head game ended complete confusion didnt catch nearly swallowed flint still howling twenty minutes later but made no difference  hadnt broken any rules lee jordan still happily shouting results  gryffindor had won by one hundred seventy points sixty heard none this though being made cup strong tea back hagrids hut with ron hermione snape ron explaining hermione i saw him cursing your broomstick muttering wouldnt take his eyes off you rubbish said hagrid who hadnt heard word what had gone on next him stands why would snape do somethin like that ron hermione

mirror erised christmas coming one morning mid  december hogwarts woke find itself covered several feet snow lake froze solid weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed quirrell around bouncing off back his turban few owls that managed battle their way through stormy sky deliver mail had be nursed back health by hagrid before they could fly off again no one could wait for holidays start while gryffindor common room great hall had roaring fires drafty corridors had become icy bitter wind rattled windows classrooms worst all were professor snapes classes down dungeons where their breath rose mist before them they kept as close as possible their hot cauldrons i do feel so sorry said draco malfoy one potions class for all those people who have stay at hogwarts for christmas because theyre not wanted at home looking over at as spoke crabbe goyle chuckled who measuring out powdered spine lion fish ignored them malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since quidditch match disgusted that slytherins had lost had tried get everyone laughing at how wide mouthed tree frog would be replacing as seeker next then hed realized that nobody found this funny because they were all so impressed at way had managed stay on his bucking broomstick so malfoy jealous angry had gone back taunting about having no proper family true that wasnt going back privet drive for christmas professor mcgonagall had come around week before making list students who would be staying for holidays had signed up at once didnt feel sorry for himself at all this would probably be best christmas hed ever had ron his brothers were staying too because mr mrs weasley were going romania visit charlie when they left dungeons at end potions they found large fir tree blocking corridor ahead two enormous feet sticking out at bottom loud puffing sound told them that hagrid behind hi hagrid want any help ron asked sticking his head through branches nah im all right thanks ron would you mind moving out way came malfoys cold drawl from behind them are you trying earn some extra money weasley hoping be gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts i suppose  that hut hagrids must seem like palace compared what your familys used ron dived at malfoy just as snape came up stairs weasley ron let go front malfoys robes provoked professor snape said hagrid sticking his huge hairy face out from behind tree malfoy insultin his family be that as may fighting is against hogwarts rules hagrid said snape silkily five points from gryffindor weasley be grateful isnt more move along all you malfoy crabbe goyle pushed roughly past tree scattering needles everywhere smirking ill get him said ron grinding his teeth at malfoys back one these days ill get him   i hate them both said malfoy snape come on cheer up its nearly christmas said hagrid tell yeh what come with me an see great hall looks treat so three them followed hagrid his tree off great hall where professor mcgonagall professor flitwick were busy with christmas decorations ah hagrid last tree  put far corner would you hall looked spectacular festoons holly mistletoe hung all around walls no less than twelve towering christmas trees stood around room some sparkling with tiny icicles some glittering with hundreds candles how many days you got left until yer holidays hagrid asked just one said hermione that reminds me  ron weve got half an hour before lunch we should be library oh yeah youre right said ron tearing his eyes away from professor flitwick who had golden bubbles blossoming out his wand trailing them over branches new tree library said hagrid following them out hall just before holidays bit keen arent yeh oh were not working told him brightly ever since you mentioned nicolas

hermione unless youd like tell us save us trouble added we mustve been through hundreds books already we cant find him anywhere  just give us hint  i know ive read his name somewhere im sayin nothin said hagrid flatly just have find out for ourselves then said ron they left hagrid looking disgruntled hurried off library they had indeed been searching books for flamels name ever since hagrid had let slip because how else were they going find out what snape trying steal trouble very hard know where begin not knowing what flamel might have done get himself into book wasnt great wizards twentieth century or notable magical names our time  missing too from important modern magical discoveries study recent developments wizardry then course there sheer size library tens thousands books thousands shelves hundreds narrow rows hermione took out list subjects titles she had decided search while ron strode off down row books started pulling them off shelves at random wandered over restricted section had been wondering for while if flamel wasnt somewhere there unfortunately you needed specially signed note from one teachers look any restricted books knew hed never get one these were books containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts only read by older students studying advanced defense against dark arts what are you looking for boy nothing said madam pince librarian brandished feather duster at him youd better get out then go on  out wishing hed been bit quicker at thinking up some story left library ron hermione had already agreed theyd better not ask madam pince where they could find flamel they were sure shed be able tell them but they couldnt risk snape hearing what they were up waited outside corridor see if other two had found anything but wasnt very hopeful they had been looking for two weeks after all but as they only had odd moments between lessons wasnt surprising theyd found nothing what they really needed nice long search without madam pince breathing down their necks five minutes later ron hermione joined him shaking their heads they went off lunch you will keep looking while im away wont you said hermione send me an owl if you find anything you could ask your parents if they know who flamel is said ron itd be safe ask them very safe as theyre both dentists said hermione once holidays had started ron were having too good time think much about flamel they had dormitory themselves common room far emptier than usual so they were able get good armchairs by fire they sat by hour eating anything they could spear on toasting fork  bread english muffins marshmallows  plotting ways getting malfoy expelled which were fun talk about even if they wouldnt work ron also started teaching wizard chess this exactly like muggle chess except that figures were alive which made lot like directing troops battle rons set very old battered like everything else owned had once belonged someone else his family  this case his grandfather however old chessmen werent drawback at all ron knew them so well never had trouble getting them do what wanted played with chessmen seamus finnigan had lent him they didnt trust him at all wasnt very good player yet they kept shouting different bits advice at him which confusing dont send me there cant you see his knight send him we can afford lose him on christmas eve went bed

scrambled out bed pulled on his bathrobe you too said will you look at this ive got some presents what did you expect turnips said ron turning his own pile which lot bigger than harrys picked up top

cloak said ron look awe on his face im sure is  try on threw cloak around his shoulders ron gave yell is look down looked down at his feet but they were gone dashed mirror sure enough his reflection

cloak seized letter written narrow loopy writing had never seen before were following words your father left this my possession before died is time returned you use well very merry christmas you there no signature stared at note ron admiring cloak id give anuthinq for one these said anuthinq whats matter nothing said felt very strange who had sent cloak had really once belonged his father before

from room his arms pinned his side by his sweater had never all his life had such christmas dinner hundred fat roast turkeys mountains roast boiled potatoes platters chipolatas tureens buttered peas silver boats thick rich gravy cranberry sauce  stacks wizard crackers every few feet along table these fantastic party favors were nothing like feeble muggle ones dursleys usually bought with their little plastic toys their flimsy paper hats inside pulled wizard cracker with fred didnt just bang went off with blast like cannon engulfed them all cloud blue smoke while from inside exploded rear admirals hat several live white mice up at high table dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizards hat for flowered bonnet chuckling merrily at joke professor flitwick had just read him flaming christmas puddings followed turkey percy nearly broke his teeth on silver sickle embedded his slice watched hagrid getting redder redder face as called for more wine finally kissing professor mcgonagall on cheek who harrys amazement giggled blushed her top hat lopsided when finally left table laden down with stack things out crackers including pack non explodable luminous balloons grow  your own warts kit his own new wizard chess set white mice had disappeared had nasty feeling they were going end up as mrs norriss christmas dinner weasleys spent happy afternoon having furious snowball fight on grounds then cold wet gasping for breath they returned fire gryffindor common room where broke his new chess set by losing spectacularly ron suspected wouldnt have lost so badly if percy hadnt tried help him so much after meal turkey sandwiches crumpets trifle christmas cake everyone felt too full sleepy do much before bed except sit watch percy chase fred george all over gryffindor tower because theyd stolen his prefect badge had been harrys best christmas day ever yet something had been nagging at back his mind all day not until climbed into bed free think about invisibility cloak whoever had sent ron full turkey cake with nothing mysterious bother him fell asleep almost as soon as hed drawn curtains his four poster leaned over side his own bed pulled cloak out from under his fathers  this had been his fathers let material flow over his hands smoother than silk light as air use well note had said had try now slipped out bed wrapped cloak around himself looking down at his legs saw only moonlight shadows very funny feeling use well suddenly felt wide awake whole hogwarts open him this cloak excitement flooded through him as stood there dark silence could go anywhere this anywhere filch would never know ron grunted his sleep should wake him something held him back  his fathers cloak  felt that this time  first time  wanted use alone crept out dormitory down stairs across common room climbed through portrait hole whos there squawked fat lady said nothing walked quickly down corridor where should go stopped his heart racing thought then came him restricted section library hed be able read as long as liked as long as took find out who flamel set off drawing invisibility cloak tight around him as walked library pitch black very eerie lit lamp see his way along rows books lamp looked as if floating along midair even though could feel his arm supporting sight gave him creeps restricted section right at back library stepping carefully over rope that separated these books from rest library held up his lamp read titles they didnt tell him much their peeling faded gold letters spelled words languages couldnt understand some had no title at all one book had dark stain on that looked horribly like blood hairs on back harrys neck prickled maybe imagining maybe not but thought faint whispering coming from books as though they knew someone there who shouldnt be had start somewhere setting lamp down carefully on floor looked along bottom shelf for an interesting looking book large black silver volume caught his eye pulled out with difficulty because very heavy balancing on his knee let fall open piercing bloodcurdling shriek split silence  book screaming snapped shut but shriek went on on one high unbroken earsplitting note stumbled backward knocked over his lamp which went out at once panicking heard footsteps coming down corridor outside  stuffing shrieking book back on shelf ran for passed filch doorway filchs pale wild eyes looked straight through him slipped under filchs outstretched arm streaked off up corridor books shrieks still ringing his ears came sudden halt front tall suit armor had been so busy getting away from library hadnt paid attention where going perhaps because dark didnt recognize where at all there suit armor near kitchens knew but must be five floors above there you asked me come directly you professor if anyone wandering around at night somebodys been library  restricted section felt blood drain out his face wherever filch must know shortcut because his soft greasy voice getting nearer his horror snape who replied restricted section well they cant be far well catch them stood rooted spot as filch snape came around corner ahead they couldnt see him course but narrow corridor if they came much nearer theyd knock right into him  cloak didnt stop him from being solid backed away as quietly as could door stood ajar his left his only hope squeezed through holding his breath trying not move his relief managed get inside room without their noticing anything they walked straight past leaned against wall breathing deeply listening their footsteps dying away that had been close very close few seconds before noticed anything about room had hidden looked like an unused classroom dark shapes desks chairs were piled against walls there an upturned wastepaper basket  but propped against wall facing him something that didnt look as if belonged there something that looked as if someone had just put there keep out way magnificent mirror as high as ceiling with an ornate gold frame standing on two clawed feet there an inscription carved around top erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi his panic fading now that there no sound filch snape moved nearer mirror wanting look at himself but see no reflection again stepped front had clap his hands his mouth stop himself from screaming whirled around his heart pounding far more furiously than when book had screamed  for had seen not only himself mirror but whole crowd people standing right behind him but room empty breathing very fast turned slowly back mirror there reflected white scared  looking there reflected behind him were at least ten others looked over his shoulder  but still no one there or were they all invisible too fact room full invisible people this mirrors trick that reflected them invisible or not looked mirror again woman standing right behind his reflection smiling at him waving reached out hand felt air behind him if she really there hed touch her their reflections were so close together but felt only air  she others existed only mirror she very pretty woman she had dark red hair her eyes  her eyes are just like mine thought edging little closer glass bright green  exactly same shape but then noticed that she crying smiling but crying at same time tall thin black haired man standing next her put his arm around her wore glasses his hair very untidy stuck up at back just as harrys did so close mirror now that his nose nearly touching that his reflection mom whispered dad they just looked at him smiling slowly looked into faces other people mirror saw other pairs green eyes like his other noses like his even little old man who looked as though had harrys knobbly knees  looking at his family for first time his life potters smiled waved at stared hungrily back at them his hands pressed flat against glass as though hoping fall right through reach them had powerful kind ache inside him half joy half terrible sadness how long stood there didnt know reflections did not fade looked looked until distant noise brought him back his senses couldnt stay here had find his way back bed tore his eyes away from his mothers face whispered ill come back

covered cloak too they had walk much more slowly next night they tried retracing harrys route from library wandering around dark passageways for nearly an hour im freezing said ron lets forget go back ivo hissed i know its here somewhere they passed ghost tall witch gliding opposite direction but saw no one else just as ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold spotted suit armor its

corridor put an end their discussion they hadnt realized how loudly they had been talking quick ron threw cloak back over them as luminous eyes mrs norris came round door ron stood quite still both thinking same thing  did cloak work on cats after what seemed an age she turned left this isnt safe  she might have gone for filch i bet she heard us come on ron pulled out room snow still hadnt

making more noise than wise but didnt meet anyone there were his mother father smiling at him again one his grandfathers nodding happily sank down sit on floor front mirror there nothing stop him from staying here all night with his family nothing at all except  so  back again harry felt as though his insides had turned ice looked behind him sitting on one desks by wall none other than albus dumbledore must have walked straight past him so desperate get mirror hadnt noticed him i  i didnt see you sir strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you said dumbledore relieved see that smiling so said dumbledore slipping off desk sit on floor with you like hundreds before you have discovered delights mirror erised i didnt know called that sir but i expect youve realized by now what does  well  shows me my family   showed your friend ron himself as head boy how did you know   i dont need cloak become invisible said dumbledore gently now can you think what mirror erised shows us all shook his head let me explain happiest man on earth would be able use mirror erised like normal mirror that is would look into see himself exactly as is does that help thought then said slowly shows us what we want  whatever we want  yes no said dumbledore quietly shows us nothing more or less than deepest most desperate desire our hearts you who have never known your family see them standing around you ronald weasley who has always been overshadowed by his brothers sees himself standing alone best all them however this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth men have wasted away before entranced by what they have seen or been driven mad not knowing if what shows is real or even possible mirror will be moved new home tomorrow i ask you not go looking for again if you ever do run across you will now be prepared does not do dwell on dreams forget live remember that now why dont you put that admirable cloak back on get off bed stood up sir  professor dumbledore can i ask you something obviously youve just done so dumbledore smiled you may ask me one more thing however what do you see when you look mirror i i see myself holding pair thick woolen socks stared one can never have enough socks said dumbledore another christmas has come gone i didnt get single pair people will insist on giving me books only when back bed that struck that dumbledore might not have been quite truthful but then thought as shoved scabbers off his pillow had been quite personal question nicholas flambl dumbledore had convinced not go looking for mirror erised again for rest christmas holidays invisibility cloak stayed folded at bottom his trunk wished could forget what hed seen mirror as easily but couldnt started having nightmares over over again dreamed about his parents disappearing flash green light while high voice cackled with laughter you see dumbledore right that mirror could drive you mad said ron when told him about these dreams hermione who came back day before term started took different view things she torn between horror at idea being out bed roaming school three nights row if filch had caught you disappointment that hadnt at least found out who nicolas flamel they had almost given up hope ever finding flamel library book even though still sure hed read name somewhere once term had started they were back skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks had even less time than other two because quidditch practice had started again wood working team harder than ever even endless rain that had replaced snow couldnt dampen his spirits weasleys complained that wood becoming fanatic but on woods side if they won their next match against hufflepuff they would overtake slytherin house championship for first time seven years quite apart from wanting win found that had fewer nightmares when tired out after training then during one particularly wet muddy practice session wood gave team bit bad news hed just gotten very angry with weasleys who kept dive bombing each other pretending fall off their brooms will you stop messing around yelled thats exactly sort thing thatll lose us match snapes refereeing this time hell be looking for any excuse knock points off gryffindor george weasley really did fall off his broom at these words  snapes refereeing spluttered through mouthful mud whens ever refereed quidditch match hes not going be fair if we might overtake slytherin rest team landed next george complain too its not my fault said wood weve just got make sure we play clean game so snape hasnt got an excuse pick on us which all very well thought but had another reason for not wanting snape near him while playing quidditch  rest team hung back talk one another as usual at end practice but headed straight back gryffindor common room where found ron hermione playing chess chess only thing hermione ever lost at something ron thought very good for her dont talk me for moment said ron when sat down next him i need concern caught sight harrys face whats matter with you you look terrible speaking quietly so that no one else would hear told other two about snape s sudden sinister desire be quidditch referee dont play said hermione at once say youre ill said ron pretend break your leg hermione suggested  really break your leg said ron i cant said there isnt reserve seeker if i back out gryffindor cant play at all at that moment neville toppled into common room how had managed climb through portrait hole anyones guess because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as leg locker curse must have had bunny hop all way up gryffindor tower everyone fell over laughing except hermione who leapt up performed countercurse nevilles legs sprang apart got his feet trembling what happened hermione asked him leading him over sit with ron malfoy said neville shakily i met him outside library said hed been looking for someone practice that on go professor mcgonagall hermione urged neville report him neville shook his head i dont want more trouble mumbled youve got stand up him neville said ron hes used walking all over people but thats no reason lie down front him make easier theres no need tell me im not brave enough be gryffindor malfoys already done that neville choked out felt pocket his robes pulled out chocolate frog very last one from box hermione had given him for christmas gave neville who looked as though might cry youre worth twelve malfoy said sorting hat chose you for gryffindor didnt wheres malfoy stinking slytherin nevilles lips twitched weak smile as unwrapped frog thanks  i think ill go bed  dyou want card you collect them dont you as neville walked away looked at famous wizard card dumbledore again said first one i ever   gasped stared at back card then looked up at ron hermione ive found him whispered ive found flamel i told you id read name somewhere before i read on train coming here  listen this dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat dark wizard grindelwald 9 for discovery twelve uses dragons blood his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamelv hermione jumped her feet she hadnt looked so excited since theyd gotten back marks for their very first piece homework stay there she said she sprinted up stairs girls dormitories ron barely had time exchange mystified looks before she dashing back an enormous old book her arms i never thought look here she whispered excitedly i got this out library weeks ago for bit light reading light said ron but hermione told him be quiet until shed looked something up started flicking frantically through pages muttering herself at last she found what she looking for i knew i knew are we allowed speak yet said ron grumpily hermione ignored him nicolas flamel she whispered dramatically is only known maker sorcerers stone this didnt have quite effect shed expected what said ron oh honestly  dont you two read look  read that there she pushed book toward them ron read ancient study alchemy is concerned with making sorcerers stone legendary substance with astonishing powers stone will transform any metal into pure gold also produces elixir life which will make drinker immortal there have been many reports sorcerers stone over centuries but only stone currently existence belongs mr nicolas flamel noted alchemist opera lover mr flamel who celebrated his six hundred sixty fifth birthday last year enjoys quiet life devon with his wife perenelle six hundred fifty eight see said hermione when ron had finished dog must be guarding flamels sorcerers stone i bet asked dumbledore keep safe for him because theyre friends knew someone after thats why wanted stone moved out gringotts stone that makes gold stops you from ever dying said no wonder snapes after anyone would want no wonder we couldnt find flamel that study recent developments wizardry said ron hes not exactly recent if hes six hundred sixty five is next morning defense against dark arts while copying down different ways treating werewolf bites ron were still discussing what theyd do with sorcerers stone if they had one wasnt until ron said hed buy his own quidditch team that remembered about snape coming match im going play told ron hermione if i dont all slytherins will think im just too scared face snape ill show them  itll really wipe smiles off their faces if we win just as long as were not wiping you off field said hermione as match drew nearer however became more more nervous whatever told ron hermione rest team wasnt too calm either idea overtaking slytherin house championship wonderful no one had done for seven years but would they be allowed with such biased referee didnt know whether imagining or not but seemed keep running into snape wherever went at times even wondered whether snape following him trying catch him on his own potions lessons were turning into sort weekly torture snape so horrible could snape possibly know theyd found out about sorcerers stone didnt see how could  yet sometimes had horrible feeling that snape could read minds knew when they wished him good luck outside locker rooms next afternoon that ron hermione were wondering whether theyd ever see him alive again this wasnt what youd call comforting hardly heard word woods pep talk as pulled on his quidditch robes picked up his nimbus two thousand ron hermione meanwhile had found place stands next neville who couldnt understand why they looked so grim worried or why they had both brought their wands match little did know that ron hermione had been secretly practicing leg locker curse theyd gotten idea from malfoy using on neville were ready use on snape if showed any sign wanting hurt now dont forget its locomotor mortis hermione muttered as ron slipped his wand up his sleeve i know ron snapped dont nag back locker room wood had taken aside dont want pressure you potter but if we ever need an early capture snitch its now finish game before snape can favor hufflepuff too much whole schools out there said fred weasley peering out door even  blimey  dumbledores come watch harrys heart did somersault dumbledore said dashing door make sure fred right there no mistaking that silver beard could have laughed out loud with relief safe there simply no way that snape would dare try hurt him if dumbledore watching perhaps that why snape looking so angry as teams marched onto field something that ron noticed too ive never seen snape look so mean told hermione look  theyre off ouch someone had poked ron back head malfoy oh sorry weasley didnt see you there malfoy grinned broadly at crabbe goyle wonder how long potters going stay on his broom this time anyone want bet what about you weasley ron didnt answer snape had just awarded hufflepuff penalty because george weasley had hit bludger at him hermione who had all her fingers crossed her lap squinting fixedly at who circling game like hawk looking for snitch you know how i think they choose people for gryffindor team said malfoy loudly few minutes later as snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all its people they feel sorry for see theres potter whos got no parents then theres weasleys whove got no money  you should be on team longbottom youve got no brains neville went bright red but turned his seat face malfoy im worth twelve you malfoy stammered malfoy crabbe goyle howled with laughter but ron still not daring take his eyes from game said you tell him neville longbottom if brains were gold youd be poorer than weasley thats saying something rons nerves were already stretched breaking point with anxiety about im warning you malfoy  one more word   ron said hermione suddenly   what where had suddenly gone into spectacular dive which drew gasps cheers from crowd hermione stood up her crossed fingers her mouth as streaked toward ground like bullet youre luck weasley potters obviously spotted some money on ground said malfoy ron snapped before malfoy knew what happening ron on top him wrestling him ground neville hesitated then clambered over back his seat help come on hermione screamed leaping onto her seat watch as sped straight at snape  she didnt even notice malfoy ron rolling around under her seat or scuffles yelps coming from whirl fists that neville crabbe goyle up air snape turned on his broomstick just time see something scarlet shoot past him missing him by inches  next second had pulled out dive his arm raised triumph snitch clasped his hand stands erupted had be record no one could ever remember snitch being caught so quickly ron ron where are you games over harrys won weve won gryffindor is lead shrieked hermione dancing up down on her seat hugging parvati patil row front jumped off his broom foot from ground couldnt believe hed done  game over had barely lasted five minutes as gryffindors came spilling onto field saw snape land nearby white faced tight lipped  then felt hand on his shoulder looked up into dumbledores smiling face well done said dumbledore quietly so that only could hear nice see you havent been brooding about that mirror    been keeping busy    excellent  snape spat bitterly on ground jc jc jc left locker room alone some time later take his nimbus two thousand back broomshed couldnt ever remember feeling happier hed really done something be proud now  no one could say just famous name any more evening air had never smelled so sweet walked over damp grass reliving last hour his head which happy blur gryffindors running lift him onto their shoulders ron hermione distance jumping up down ron cheering through heavy nosebleed had reached shed leaned against wooden door looked up at hogwarts with its windows glowing red setting sun gryffindor lead hed done hed shown snape  speaking snape    hooded figure came swiftly down front steps castle clearly not wanting be seen walked as fast as possible toward forbidden forest harrys victory faded from his mind as watched recognized figures prowling walk snape sneaking into forest while everyone else at dinner  what going on jumped back on his nimbus two thousand took off gliding silently over castle saw snape enter forest at run followed trees were so thick couldnt see where snape had gone flew circles lower lower brushing top branches trees until heard voices glided toward them landed noiselessly towering beech tree climbed carefully along one branches holding tight his broomstick trying see through leaves below shadowy clearing stood snape but wasnt alone quirrell there too couldnt make out look on his face but stuttering worse than ever strained catch what they were saying  d dont know why you wanted t t meet here all p places severus  oh i thought wed keep this private said snape his voice icy students arent supposed know about sorcerers stone after all leaned forward quirrell mumbling something snape interrupted him have you found out how get past that beast hagrids yet b b but severus i   you dont want me as your enemy quirrell said snape taking step toward him i i dont know what you   you know perfectly well what i mean an owl hooted loudly nearly fell out tree steadied himself time hear snape say   your little bit hocus pocus im waiting b but i d d dont   very well snape cut well have another little chat soon when youve had time think things over decided where your loyalties lie threw his cloak over his head strode out clearing almost dark now but could see quirrell standing quite still as though petrified jc jc jc where have you been hermione squeaked we won you won we won shouted ron thumping on back i gave malfoy black eye neville tried take on crabbe goyle single  handed hes still out cold but madam pomfrey says hell be all right  talk about showing slytherin everyones waiting for you common room were having party fred george stole some cakes stuff from kitchens never mind that now said breathlessly lets find an empty room you wait til you hear this  made sure peeves wasnt inside before shutting door behind them then told them what hed seen heard so we were right is sorcerers stone snapes trying force quirrell help him get asked if knew how get past fluffy  said something about quirrells hocus pocus  i reckon there are other things guarding stone apart from fluffy loads enchantments probably quirrell would have done some anti dark arts spell that snape needs break through   so you mean stones only safe as long as quirrell stands up snape said hermione alarm itll be gone by next tuesday said ron norbert norwegian ridgeback quirrell however must have been braver than theyd thought weeks that followed did seem be getting paler thinner but didnt look as though hed cracked yet every time they passed third floor corridor ron hermione would press their ears door check that fluffy still growling inside snape sweeping about his usual bad temper which surely meant that stone still safe whenever passed quirrell these days gave him an encouraging sort smile ron had started telling people off for laughing at quirrells stutter hermione however had more on her mind than sorcerers stone she had started drawing up study schedules color coding all her notes ron wouldnt have minded but she kept nagging them do same hermione exams are ages away ten weeks hermione snapped thats not ages thats like second nicolas flamel but were not six hundred years old ron reminded her anyway what are you studying for you already know all what am i studying for are you crazy you realize we need pass these exams get into second year theyre very important i should have started studying month ago i dont know whats gotten into me unfortunately teachers seemed be thinking along same lines as hermione they piled so much homework on them that easter holidays werent

trying get through all their extra work ill never remember this ron burst out one afternoon throwing down his quill looking longingly out library window first really fine day theyd had months sky clear forget me not blue there feeling air summer coming who looking up dittany one thousand magical herbs fungi didnt look up until heard ron say hagrid what are you doing library hagrid shuffled

got my boot  jus playin  hes only baby after all baby banged its tail on wall making windows rattle hermione walked back castle feeling saturday couldnt come quickly enough they would have felt sorry for hagrid when time came for him say good bye norbert if they hadnt been so worried about what they had do very dark cloudy night they were bit late arriving at hagrid s hut because theyd had wait for peeves get out their way entrance hall where hed been playing tennis against wall hagrid had norbert packed ready large crate hes got lots o rats an some brandy fer journey said hagrid muffled voice an ive packed his teddy bear case gets lonely from inside crate came ripping noises that sounded as though teddy having his head torn off bye bye norbert hagrid sobbed as hermione covered crate with invisibility cloak stepped underneath themselves mommy will never forget you how they managed get crate back up castle they never knew midnight ticked nearer as they heaved norbert up marble staircase entrance hall along dark corridors up another staircase then another  even one harrys shortcuts didnt make work much easier nearly there panted as they reached corridor beneath tallest tower then sudden movement ahead them made them almost drop crate forgetting that they were already invisible they shrank into shadows staring at dark outlines two people grappling with each other ten feet away lamp flared professor mcgonagall tartan bathrobe hair net had malfoy by ear detention she shouted twenty points from slytherin wandering around middle night how dare you   you dont understand professor potters coming  hes got dragon what utter rubbish how dare you tell such lies come on  i shall see professor snape about you malfoy steep spiral staircase up top tower seemed easiest thing world after that not until theyd stepped out into cold night air did they throw off cloak glad be able breathe properly again hermione did sort jig malfoys got detention i could sing dont advised her chuckling about malfoy they waited norbert thrashing about his crate about ten minutes later four broomsticks came swooping down out darkness charlies friends were cheery lot they showed hermione harness theyd rigged up so they could suspend norbert between them they all helped buckle norbert safely into then hermione shook hands with others thanked them very much at last norbert going  going  gone they slipped back down spiral staircase their hearts as light as their hands now that norbert off them no more dragon  malfoy detention  what could spoil their happiness answer that waiting at foot stairs as they stepped into corridor filchs face loomed suddenly out darkness well well well whispered we are trouble theyd left invisibility cloak on top tower forbidden forest things couldnt have been worse filch took them down professor mcgonagalls study on first floor where they sat waited without saying word each other hermione trembling excuses alibis wild cover up stories chased each other around harrys brain each more feeble than last couldnt see how they were going get out trouble this time they were cornered how could they have been so stupid as forget cloak there no reason on earth that professor mcgonagall would accept for their being out bed creeping around school dead night let alone being up tallest astronomy tower which out bounds except for classes add norbert invisibility cloak they might as well be packing their bags already had thought that things couldnt have been worse wrong when professor mcgonagall appeared she leading neville neville burst out moment saw other two i trying find you warn you i heard malfoy saying going catch you said you had drag   shook his head violently shut neville up but professor mcgonagall had seen she looked more likely breathe fire than norbert as she towered over three them i would never have believed any you mr filch says you were up astronomy tower its one oclock morning explain yourselves first time hermione had ever failed answer teachers question she staring at her slippers as still as statue i think ive got good idea whats been going on said professor mcgonagall doesnt take genius work out you fed draco malfoy some cock  bull story about dragon trying get him out bed into trouble ive already caught him i suppose you think its funny that longbottom here heard story believed too caught nevilles eye tried tell him without words that this wasnt true because neville looking stunned hurt poor blundering neville  knew what must have cost him try find them dark warn them im disgusted said professor mcgonagall four students out bed one night ive never heard such thing before you miss granger i thought you had more sense as for you mr potter i thought gryffindor meant more you than this all three you will receive detentions  yes you too mr longbottom nothing gives you right walk around school at night especially these days its very dangerous  fifty points will be taken from gryffindor fifty gasped  they would lose lead lead hed won last quidditch match fifty points each said professor mcgonagall breathing heavily through her long pointed nose professor  please   you cant dont tell me what i can cant do potter now get back bed all you ive never been more ashamed gryffindor students hundred fifty points lost that put gryffindor last place one night theyd ruined any chance gryffindor had had for house cup felt as though bottom had dropped out his stomach how could they ever make up for this didnt sleep all night could hear neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours couldnt think anything say comfort him knew neville like himself dreading dawn what would happen when rest gryffindor found out what theyd done at first gryffindors passing giant hourglasses that recorded house points next day thought there d been mistake how could they suddenly have hundred fifty points fewer than yesterday then story started spread potter famous potter their hero two quidditch matches had lost them all those points him couple other stupid first years from being one most popular admired people at school suddenly most hated even ravenclaws hufflepuffs turned on him because everyone had been longing see slytherin lose house cup everywhere went people pointed didnt trouble lower their voices as they insulted him slytherins on other hand clapped as walked past them whistling cheering thanks potter we owe you one only ron stood by him theyll all forget this few weeks fred george have lost loads points all time theyve been here people still like them theyve never lost hundred fifty points one go though have they said miserably well  no ron admitted bit late repair damage but swore himself not meddle things that werent his business from now on hed had with sneaking around spying felt so ashamed himself that went wood offered resign from quidditch team resign wood thundered what goodll that do how are we going get any points back if we cant win at quidditch but even quidditch had lost its fun rest team wouldnt speak during practice if they had speak about him they called him seeker hermione neville were suffering too they didnt have as bad time as because they werent as well known but nobody would speak them either hermione had stopped drawing attention herself class keeping her head down working silence almost glad that exams werent far away all studying had do kept his mind off his misery ron hermione kept themselves working late into night trying remember ingredients complicated potions learn charms spells by heart memorize dates magical discoveries goblin rebellions  then about week before exams were due start harrys new resolution not interfere anything that didnt concern him put an unexpected test walking back from library on his own one afternoon heard somebody whimpering from classroom up ahead as drew closer heard quirrells voice no  no  not again please   sounded as though someone threatening him moved closer all right  all right   heard quirrell sob next second quirrell came hurrying out classroom straightening his turban pale looked as though about cry strode out sight didnt think quirrell had even noticed him waited until quirrells footsteps had disappeared then peered into classroom empty but door stood ajar at other end halfway toward before remembered what hed promised himself about not meddling all same hed have gambled twelve sorcerers stones that snape had just left room from what had just heard snape would be walking with new spring his step  quirrell seemed have given at last went back library where hermione testing ron on astronomy told them what hed heard snapes done then said ron if quirrells told him how break his anti dark force spell   theres still fluffy though said hermione maybe snapes found out how get past him without asking hagrid said ron looking up at thousands books surrounding them i bet theres book somewhere here telling you how get past giant three headed dog so what do we do light adventure kindling again rons eyes but hermione answered before could go dumbledore thats what we should have done ages ago if we try anything ourselves well be thrown out for sure but weve got no proof said quirrells too scared back us up snapes only got say doesnt know how troll got at halloween that nowhere near third floor  who do you think theyll believe him or us its not exactly secret we hate him dumbledore ll think we made up get him sacked filch wouldnt help us if his life depended on hes too friendly with snape more students get thrown out better hell think dont forget were not supposed know about stone or fluffy thatll take lot explaining hermione looked convinced but ron didnt if we just do bit poking around   no said flatly weve done enough poking around pulled map jupiter toward him started learn names its moons following morning notes were delivered hermione neville at breakfast table they were all same your detention will take place at eleven oclock tonight meet mr filch entrance hall professor m mcgonagall had forgotten they still had detentions do furor over points theyd lost half expected hermione complain that this whole night studying lost but she didnt say word like she felt they deserved what theyd got at eleven oclock that night they said good bye ron common room went down entrance hall with neville filch already there  so malfoy had also forgotten that malfoy had gotten detention too follow me said filch lighting lamp leading them outside i bet youll think twice about breaking school rule again wont you eh

my office keep em well oiled case theyre ever needed  right off we go dont think running off now itll be worse for you if you do they marched off across dark grounds neville kept sniffing wondered what their punishment going be must be something really horrible or filch wouldnt be sounding so delighted moon bright but clouds scudding across kept throwing them into darkness ahead could see lighted windows hagrids hut then they heard distant shout is that you filch hurry up i want ter get started harrys heart rose if they were going be working with hagrid wouldnt be so bad his relief must have showed his face because filch said i suppose you think youll be enjoying yourself with that oaf well think again boy  its into forest youre going im much mistaken if youll all come out one piece at this neville let out little moan malfoy stopped dead his tracks forest repeated didnt sound quite as cool as usual we cant go there at night  theres all sorts things there  werewolves i heard neville clutched sleeve harrys robe made choking noise thats your problem isnt said filch his voice cracking with glee shouldve thought them werewolves before you got trouble shouldnt you hagrid came striding toward them out dark fang at his heel carrying his large crossbow quiver arrows hung over his shoulder abou time said i bin waitin fer half an hour already all right hermione i shouldnt be

now listen carefully cause its dangerous what were gonna do tonight an i don want no one takin risks follow me over here moment led them very edge forest holding his lamp up high pointed down narrow winding earth track that disappeared into thick black trees light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into forest look there said hagrid see that stuff shinin on ground silvery stuff thats unicorn blood theres unicorn there bin hurt badly by summat this is second time week i found one dead last wednesday were gonna try an find poor thing we might have ter put out its misery what if whatever

path while malfoy neville fang took right they walked silence their eyes on ground every now then ray moonlight through branches above lit spot silver blue blood on fallen leaves saw that hagrid looked very worried  could werewolf be killing unicorns asked not fast enough said hagrid its not easy ter catch unicorn theyre powerful magic creatures i never knew one ter be hurt before they walked past mossy tree stump could hear running water there must be stream somewhere close by there were still spots unicorn blood here there along winding path you all right hermione hagrid whispered don worry cantve gone far if its this badly hurt an then well be able ter  get behind that tree hagrid seized hermione hoisted them off path behind towering oak pulled out an arrow fitted into his crossbow raising ready fire three them listened something slithering over dead leaves nearby sounded like cloak trailing along ground hagrid squinting up dark path but after few seconds sound faded away i knew murmured theres summat here that shouldn be werewolf suggested that wasn no werewolf an wasn no unicorn neither said hagrid grimly right follow me but careful now they walked more slowly ears straining for faintest sound suddenly clearing ahead something definitely moved whos there hagrid called show yerself  im armed into clearing came  man or horse waist man with red hair beard but below that horses gleaming chestnut body with long reddish tail hermiones jaws dropped oh its you ronan said hagrid relief how are yeh walked forward shook centaurs hand good evening you hagrid said ronan had deep sorrowful voice were you going shoot me cant be too careful ronan said hagrid patting his crossbow theres summat bad loose this forest this is potter an hermione granger by way students up at school an this is ronan you two hes centaur wed noticed said hermione faintly good evening said ronan students are you do you learn much up at school erm   bit said hermione timidly bit well thats something ronan sighed flung back his head stared at sky mars is bright tonight yeah said hagrid glancing up too listen im glad weve run inter yeh ronan cause theres unicorn bin hurt  you seen anythin ronan didnt answer immediately stared unblinkingly upward then sighed again always innocent are first victims said so has been for ages past so is now yeah said hagrid but have yeh seen anythin ronan anythin unusual mars is bright tonight ronan repeated while hagrid watched him impatiently unusually bright yeah but i meanin anythin unusual bit nearer home said hagrid so yeh havent noticed anythin strange yet again ronan took while answer at last said forest hides many secrets movement trees behind ronan made hagrid raise his bow again but only second centaur black haired  bodied wilder looking than ronan hullo bane said hagrid all right good evening hagrid i hope you are well well enough look ive jus bin askin ronan you seen anythin odd here lately theres unicorn bin injured  would yeh know anythin about bane walked over stand next ronan looked skyward mars is bright tonight said simply weve heard said hagrid grumpily well if either you do see anythin let me know wont yeh well be off then hermione followed him out clearing staring over their shoulders at ronan bane until trees blocked their view never said hagrid irritably try an get straight answer out centaur ruddy stargazers not interested anythin closern moon are there many them here asked hermione oh fair few    keep themselves themselves mostly but theyre good enough about turnin up if ever i want word theyre deep mind centaurs  they know things  jus don let on much dyou think that centaur we heard earlier said did that sound like hooves you nah if yeh ask me that whats bin killin unicorns  never heard anythin like before they walked on through dense dark trees kept looking nervously over his shoulder had nasty feeling they were being watched very glad they had hagrid his crossbow with them they had just passed bend path when hermione grabbed hagrid s arm hagrid look red sparks others are trouble you two wait here hagrid shouted stay on path ill come back for yeh they heard him crashing away through undergrowth stood looking at each other very scared until they couldnt hear anything but rustling leaves around them you dont think theyve been hurt do you whispered hermione i dont care if malfoy has but if somethings got neville  its our fault hes here first place minutes dragged by their ears seemed sharper than usual harrys seemed be picking up every sigh wind every cracking twig what going on where were others at last great crunching noise announced hagrids return malfoy neville fang were with him hagrid fuming malfoy seemed had sneaked up behind neville grabbed him as joke neville had panicked sent up sparks well be lucky ter catch anythin now with racket you two were makin right were changin groups  neville you stay with me an hermione you go with fang an this idiot im sorry hagrid added whisper but hell have harder time frightenin you an weve gotta get this done so set off into heart forest with malfoy fang they walked for nearly half an hour deeper deeper into forest until path became almost impossible follow because trees were so thick thought blood seemed be getting thicker there were splashes on roots tree as though poor creature had been thrashing around pain close by could see clearing ahead through tangled branches an ancient oak look   murmured holding out his arm stop malfoy something bright white gleaming on ground they inched closer unicorn all right dead had never seen anything so beautiful sad its long slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where had fallen its mane spread pearly white on dark leaves had taken one step toward when slithering sound made him freeze where stood bush on edge clearing quivered  then out shadows hooded figure came crawling across ground like some stalking beast malfoy fang stood transfixed cloaked figure reached unicorn lowered its head over wound animals side began drink its blood aaaaaaaaaaargh   malfoy let out terrible scream bolted  so did fang hooded figure raised its head looked right at  unicorn blood dribbling down its front got its feet came swiftly toward  couldnt move for fear then pain like hed never felt before pierced his head as though his scar were on fire half blinded staggered backward heard hooves behind him galloping something jumped clean over charging at figure pain harrys head so bad fell his knees took minute or two pass when looked up figure had gone centaur standing over him not ronan or bane this one looked younger had white blond hair palomino body are you all right said centaur pulling his feet yes  thank you  what that centaur didnt answer had astonishingly blue eyes like pale sapphires looked carefully at his eyes lingering on scar that stood out livid on harrys forehead you are potter boy said you had better get back hagrid forest is not safe at this time  especially for you can you ride will be quicker this way my name is firenze added as lowered himself on his front legs so that could clamber onto his back there suddenly sound more galloping from other side clearing ronan bane came bursting through trees their flanks heaving sweaty firenze bane thundered what are you doing you have human on your back have you no shame are you common mule do you realize who this is said firenze this is potter boy quicker leaves this forest better what have you been telling him growled bane remember firenze we are sworn not set ourselves against heavens have we not read what is come movements planets ronan pawed ground nervously im sure firenze thought acting for best said his gloomy voice bane kicked his back legs anger for best what is that do with us centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold is not our business run around like donkeys after stray humans our forest firenze suddenly reared on his hind legs anger so that had grab his shoulders stay on do you not see that unicorn firenze bellowed at bane do you not understand why killed or have planets not let you on that secret i set myself against what is lurking this forest bane yes with humans alongside me if i must firenze whisked around with clutching on as best could they plunged off into trees leaving ronan bane behind them didnt have clue what going on whys bane so angry asked what that thing you saved me from anyway firenze slowed walk warned keep his head bowed case low hanging branches but did not answer harrys question they made their way through trees silence for so long that thought firenze didnt want talk him anymore they were passing through particularly dense patch trees however when firenze suddenly stopped potter do you know what unicorn blood is used for no said startled by odd question weve only used horn tail hair potions that is because is monstrous thing slay unicorn said firenze only one who has nothing lose everything gain would commit such crime blood unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death but at terrible price you have slain something pure defenseless save yourself you will have but half life cursed life from moment blood touches your lips stared at back firenzes head which dappled silver moonlight but whod be that desperate wondered aloud if youre going be cursed forever deaths better isnt it is firenze agreed unless all you need is stay alive long enough drink something else  something that will bring you back full strength power  something that will mean you can never die mr potter do you know what is hidden school at this very moment sorcerers stone course  elixir life but i dont understand who   can you think nobody who has waited many years return power who has clung life awaiting their chance as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harrys heart over rustling trees seemed hear once more what hagrid had told him on night they had met some say died codswallop my opinion dunno if had enough human left him die do you mean croaked that voz   harry are you all right hermione running toward them down path hagrid puffing along behind her im fine said hardly knowing what saying unicorns dead hagrid its that clearing back there this is where i leave you firenze murmured as hagrid hurried off examine unicorn you are safe now slid off his back good luck potter said firenze planets have been read wrongly before now even by centaurs i hope this is one those times turned cantered back into depths forest leaving shivering behind him ron had fallen asleep dark common room waiting for them return shouted something about quidditch fouls when roughly shook him awake matter seconds though wide  eyed as began tell him hermione what had happened forest couldnt sit down paced up down front fire still shaking snape wants stone for voldemort  voldemorts waiting forest  all this time we thought snape just wanted get rich  stop saying name said ron terrified whisper as if thought voldemort could hear them wasnt listening firenze saved me but shouldnt have done so  bane furious  talking about interfering with what planets say is going happen  they must show that voldemorts coming back  bane thinks firenze should have let voldemort kill me  i suppose thats written stars as well will you stop saying name ron hissed so all ive got wait for now is snape steal stone went on feverishly then voldemort will be able come finish me off  well i suppose bane  be happy hermione looked very frightened but she had word comfort everyone says dumbledores only one you know who ever afraid with dumbledore around you know who wont touch you anyway who says centaurs are right sounds like fortune telling me professor mcgonagall says thats very imprecise branch magic sky had turned light before they stopped talking they went bed exhausted their throats sore but nights surprises werent over when pulled back his sheets found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them there note pinned just case through trapdoor years come would never quite remember how had managed get through his exams when half expected voldemort come bursting through door at any moment yet days crept by there could be no doubt that fluffy still alive well behind locked door sweltering hot especially large classroom where they did their written papers they had been given special new quills for exams which had been bewitched with an anti cheating spell they had practical exams as well professor flitwick called them one by one into his class see if they could make pineapple tap dance across desk professor mcgonagall watched them turn mouse into snuffbox  points were given for how pretty snuffbox but taken away if had whiskers snape made them all nervous breathing down their necks while they tried remember how make forgetfulness potion did best could trying ignore stabbing pains his forehead which had been bothering him ever since his trip into forest neville thought had bad case exam nerves because couldnt sleep but truth that kept being woken by his old nightmare except that now worse than ever because there hooded figure dripping blood maybe because they hadnt seen what had seen forest or because they didnt have scars burning on their foreheads but ron hermione didnt seem as worried about stone as idea voldemort certainly scared them but didnt keep visiting them dreams they were so busy with their studying they didnt have much time fret about what snape or anyone else might be up their very last exam history magic one hour answering questions about batty old wizards whod invented self stirring cauldrons theyd be free free for whole wonderful week until their exam results came out when ghost professor binns told them put down their quills roll up their parchment couldnt help cheering with rest that far easier than i thought would be said hermione as they joined crowds flocking out onto sunny grounds i neednt have learned about  werewolf code conduct or uprising elfric eager hermione always liked go through their exam papers afterward but ron said this made him feel ill so they wandered down lake flopped under tree weasley twins lee jordan were tickling tentacles giant squid which basking warm shallows no more studying ron sighed happily stretching out on grass you could look more cheerful weve got week before we find out how badly weve done theres no need worry yet rubbing his forehead i wish i knew what this means burst out angrily my scar keeps hurting  its happened before but never as often as this go madam pomfrey hermione suggested im not ill said i think its warning  means dangers coming  ron couldnt get worked up too hot relax hermione s right stones safe as long as dumbledores around anyway weve never had any proof snape found out how get past fluffy nearly had his leg ripped off once hes not going try again hurry neville will play quidditch for england before hagrid lets dumbledore down nodded but couldnt shake off lurking feeling that there something hed forgotten do something important when tried explain this hermione said thats just exams i woke up last night halfway through my transfiguration notes before i remembered wed done that one quite sure unsettled feeling didnt have anything do with work though watched an owl flutter toward school across bright blue sky note clamped its mouth hagrid only one who ever sent him letters hagrid would never betray dumbledore hagrid would never tell anyone how get past fluffy    never    but  suddenly jumped his feet where re you going said ron sleepily ive just thought something said had turned white weve got go see hagrid now why panted hermione hurrying keep up dont you think its bit odd said scrambling up grassy slope that what hagrid wants more than anything else is dragon stranger turns up who just happens have an egg his pocket how many people wander around with dragon eggs if its against wizard law lucky they found hagrid dont you think why didnt i see before what are you talking about said ron but sprinting across grounds toward forest didnt answer hagrid sitting an armchair outside his house his trousers sleeves were rolled up shelling peas into large bowl hullo said smiling finished yer exams got time fer drink yes please said ron but cut him off no were hurry hagrid ive got ask you something you know that night you won norbert what did stranger you were playing cards with look like dunno said hagrid casually wouldn take his cloak off saw three

down next bowl peas what did you talk him about hagrid did you mention hogwarts at all mighta come up said hagrid frowning as tried remember yeah  asked what i did an i told him i gamekeeper here

an hell go straight off ter sleep   hagrid suddenly looked horrified i shouldnta told yeh that blurted out forget i said hey  wherere yeh goin ron hermione didnt speak each other at all until they came halt entrance hall which seemed very cold gloomy after grounds weve got go dumbledore said hagrid told that stranger how get past fluffy either snape or voldemort under that cloak  mustve been easy once hed got hagrid drunk i just hope dumbledore believes us firenze might back us up if bane doesnt stop him wheres dumbledores office they looked around as if hoping see sign pointing them right direction they had never been told where dumbledore lived nor did they know anyone who had been sent see him well just have   began but voice suddenly rang across hall what are you three doing inside professor mcgonagall carrying large pile books we want see professor dumbledore said hermione rather bravely ron thought see professor dumbledore professor mcgonagall repeated as though this very fishy thing want do why swallowed  now what its sort secret said but wished at once hadnt because professor mcgonagalls nostrils flared professor dumbledore left ten minutes ago she said coldly received an urgent owl from ministry magic flew off for london at once hes gone said frantically now professor dumbledore is very great wizard potter has many demands on his time   but this is important something you have say is more important than ministry magic potter look said throwing caution winds professor  its about sorcerers stone   whatever professor mcgonagall had expected wasnt that books she carrying tumbled out her arms but she didnt pick them up how do you know   she spluttered professor i think  i know  that sn  that someones going try steal stone ive got talk professor dumbledore she eyed him with mixture shock suspicion professor dumbledore will be back tomorrow she said finally i dont know how you found out about stone but rest assured no one can possibly steal its too well protected but professor   potter i know what im talking about she said shortly she bent down gathered up fallen books i suggest you all go back outside enjoy sunshine but they didnt its tonight said once sure professor mcgonagall out earshot snapes going through trapdoor tonight hes found out everything needs now hes got dumbledore out way sent that note i bet ministry magic will get real shock when dumbledore turns up but what can we   hermione gasped ron wheeled round snape standing there good afternoon said smoothly they stared at him you shouldnt be inside on day like this said with an odd twisted smile we were   began without any idea what going say you want be more careful said snape hanging around like this people will think youre up something gryffindor really cant afford lose any more points can flushed they turned go outside but snape called them back be warned potter  any more nighttime wanderings i will personally make sure you are expelled good day you strode off direction staffroom out on stone steps turned others right heres what weve got do whispered urgently one us has got keep an eye on snape  wait outside staffroom follow him if leaves

fourteen b wrong      oh shut up said hermione but she agreed go watch out for snape wed better stay outside third floor corridor told ron come on but that part plan didnt work no sooner had they reached door separating fluffy from rest school than professor mcgonagall turned up again this time she lost her temper i suppose you think youre harder get past than pack enchantments she stormed enough this nonsense if i hear youve come anywhere near here again ill take another fifty points from gryffindor yes weasley from my own house ron went back common room had just said at least hermiones on snapes tail when portrait fat lady swung open hermione came im sorry she wailed snape came out asked me what i doing so i said i waiting for flitwick snape went get him ive only just got

that i got hundred twelve percent on his exam theyre not throwing me out after that after dinner three them sat nervously apart common room nobody bothered them none gryffindors had anything say any more after all this first night hadnt been upset by hermione skimming through all her notes hoping come across one enchantments they were about try break ron didnt talk much both them were thinking about what they were about do slowly room emptied as people drifted off bed better get cloak ron muttered as lee jordan finally left stretching yawning ran upstairs their dark dormitory pulled out cloak then his eyes fell on flute hagrid had given him for christmas pocketed use on fluffy  didnt feel much like singing ran back down common room wed better put cloak on here make sure covers all three us  if filch spots one our feet wandering along on its own   what are you doing said voice from corner room neville appeared from behind an armchair clutching trevor toad who looked as though hed been making another bid for freedom nothing neville nothing said hurriedly putting cloak behind his back neville stared at their guilty faces youre going out again said no no no said hermione no were not why dont you go bed neville looked at grandfather clock by door they couldnt afford waste any more time snape might even now be playing fluffy sleep you cant go out said neville youll be caught again gryffindor will be even more trouble you dont understand said this is important but neville clearly steeling himself do something desperate i wont let you do said hurrying stand front portrait hole ill  ill fight you neville ron exploded get away from that hole dont be an idiot   dont you call me an idiot said neville i dont think you should be breaking any more rules you were one who told me stand up people yes but not us said ron exasperation neville you dont know what youre doing took step forward neville dropped trevor toad who leapt out sight go on then try hit me said neville raising his fists im ready turned hermione do something said desperately hermione stepped forward neville she said im really really sorry about this she raised her wand petrificus totalusl she cried pointing at neville nevilles arms snapped his sides his legs sprang together his whole body rigid swayed where stood then fell flat on his face stiff as board hermione ran turn him over nevilles jaws were jammed together so couldnt speak only his eyes were moving looking at them horror whatve you done him whispered its full body bind said hermione miserably oh neville im so sorry we had neville no time explain said youll understand later neville said ron as they stepped over him pulled on invisibility cloak but leaving neville lying motionless on floor didnt feel like very good omen their nervous state every statues shadow looked like filch every distant breath wind sounded like peeves swooping down on them at foot first set stairs they spotted mrs norris skulking near top oh lets kick her just this once ron whispered harrys ear but shook his head as they climbed carefully around her mrs norris turned her lamplike eyes on them but didnt do anything they didnt meet anyone else until they reached staircase up third floor peeves bobbing halfway up loosening carpet so that people would trip whos there said suddenly as they climbed toward him narrowed his wicked black eyes know youre there even if i cant see you are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie rose up air floated there squinting at them should call filch i should if somethings creeping around unseen had sudden idea peeves said hoarse whisper bloody baron has his own reasons for being invisible peeves almost fell out air shock caught himself time hovered about foot off stairs so sorry your bloodiness mr baron sir said greasily my mistake my mistake  i didnt see you  course i didnt youre invisible  forgive old peevsie his little joke sir i have business here peeves croaked stay away from this place tonight i will sir i most certainly will said peeves rising up air again hope your business goes well baron ill not bother you scooted off brilliant whispered ron few seconds later they were there outside third floor corridor  door already ajar well there you are said quietly snapes already got past fluffy seeing open door somehow seemed impress upon all three them what facing them underneath cloak turned other two if you want go back i wont blame you said you can take cloak i wont need now dont be stupid said ron were coming said hermione pushed door open as door creaked low rumbling growls met their ears all three dogs noses sniffed madly their direction even though couldnt see them whats that at its feet hermione whispered looks like harp said ron snape must have left there must wake up moment you stop playing said well here goes  put hagrids flute his lips blew wasnt really tune but from first note beasts eyes began droop hardly drew breath slowly dogs growls ceased  tottered on its paws fell its knees then slumped ground fast asleep keep playing ron warned as they slipped out cloak crept toward trapdoor they could feel dogs hot smelly breath as they approached giant heads i think well be able pull door open said ron peering over dogs back want go first hermione no i dont all right ron gritted his teeth stepped carefully over dogs legs bent pulled ring trapdoor which swung up open what can you see hermione said anxiously nothing  just black  theres no way climbing down well just have drop who still playing flute waved at ron get his attention pointed at himself you want go first are you sure said ron i dont know how deep this thing goes give flute hermione so she can keep him asleep handed flute over few seconds silence dog growled twitched but moment hermione began play fell back into its deep sleep climbed over looked down through trapdoor there no sign bottom lowered himself through hole until hanging on by his fingertips then looked up at ron said if anything happens me dont follow go straight owlery send hedwig dumbledore right right said ron see you minute i hope  let go cold damp air rushed past him as fell down down down  flump with funny muffled sort thump landed on something soft sat up felt around his eyes not used gloom felt as though sitting on some sort plant its okay called up light size postage stamp which open trapdoor its soft landing you can jump ron followed right away landed sprawled next whats this stuff were his first words dunno some sort plant thing i suppose its here break fall come on hermione distant music stopped there loud bark from dog but hermione had already jumped she landed on harrys other side we must be miles under school she said lucky this plant things here really said ron lucky shrieked hermione look at you both she leapt up struggled toward damp wall she had struggle because moment she had landed plant had started twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles as for ron their legs had already been bound tightly long creepers without their noticing hermione had managed free herself before plant got firm grip on her now she watched horror as two boys fought pull plant off them but more they strained against tighter faster plant wound around them stop moving hermione ordered them i know what this is  its devils snare oh im so glad we know what its called thats great help snarled ron leaning back trying stop plant from curling around his neck shut up im trying remember how kill said hermione well hurry up i cant breathe gasped wrestling with as curled around his chest devils snare devils snare  what did professor sprout say  likes dark damp   so light fire choked yes  course  but theres no wood hermione cried wringing her hands have you gone mad ron bellowed are you witch or not oh right said hermione she whipped out her wand waved muttered something sent jet same bluebell flames she had used on snape at plant matter seconds two boys felt loosening its grip as cringed away from light warmth wriggling flailing unraveled itself from their bodies they were able pull free lucky you pay attention herbology hermione said as joined her by wall wiping sweat off his face yeah said ron lucky doesnt lose his head crisis  theres no wood honestly this way said pointing down stone passageway which only way forward all they could hear apart from their footsteps gentle drip water trickling down walls passageway sloped downward reminded gringotts with an unpleasant jolt heart remembered dragons said be guarding vaults wizards bank if they met dragon fully grown dragon  norbert had been bad enough  can you hear something ron whispered listened soft rustling clinking seemed be coming from up ahead do you think its ghost i dont know  sounds like wings me theres light ahead  i can see something moving they reached end passageway saw before them brilliantly lit chamber its ceiling arching high above them full small jewel  bright birds fluttering tumbling all around room on opposite side chamber heavy wooden door do you think theyll attack us if we cross room said ron probably said they dont look very vicious but i suppose if they all swooped down at once    well theres no other choice  ill run took deep breath covered his face with his arms sprinted across room expected feel sharp beaks claws tearing at him any second but nothing happened reached door untouched pulled handle but locked other two followed him they tugged heaved at door but wouldnt budge not even when hermione tried her alohomora charm now what said ron these birds  they cant be here just for decoration said hermione they watched birds soaring overhead glittering  glittering theyre not birds said suddenly theyre keys winged keys  look carefully so that must mean  looked around chamber while other two squinted up at flock keys  yes  look broomsticks weve got catch key door but there are hundreds them ron examined lock on door were looking for big old fashioned one  probably silver like handle they each seized broomstick kicked off into air soaring into midst cloud keys they grabbed snatched but bewitched keys darted dived so quickly almost impossible catch one not for nothing though youngest seeker century had knack for spotting things other people didnt after minutes weaving about through whirl rainbow feathers noticed large silver key that had bent wing as if had already been caught stuffed roughly into keyhole that one called others that big one  there  no there  with bright blue wings  feathers are all crumpled on one side ron went speeding direction that pointing crashed into ceiling nearly fell off his broom weve got close on called not taking his eyes off key with damaged wing ron you come at from above  hermione stay below stop from going down  ill try catch right now ron dived hermione rocketed upward key dodged them both streaked after it sped toward wall leaned forward with nasty crunching noise pinned against stone with one hand ron hermione s cheers echoed around high chamber they landed quickly ran door key struggling his hand rammed into lock turned  worked moment lock had clicked open key took flight again looking very battered now that had been caught twice ready asked other two his hand on door handle they nodded pulled door open next chamber so dark they couldnt see anything at all but as they stepped into light suddenly flooded room reveal an astonishing sight they were standing on edge huge chessboard behind black chessmen which were all taller than they were carved from what looked like black stone facing them way across chamber were white pieces ron hermione shivered slightly  towering white chessmen had no faces now what do we do whispered its obvious isnt said ron weve got play our way across room behind white pieces they could see another door how said hermione nervously i think said ron were going have be chessmen walked up black knight put his hand out touch knights horse at once stone sprang life horse pawed ground knight turned his helmeted head look down at ron do we  er  have join you get across black knight nodded ron turned other two this needs thinking about  said i suppose weve got take place three black pieces hermione stayed quiet watching ron think finally said now dont be offended or anything but neither you are that good at chess  were not offended said quickly just tell us what do well you take place that bishop hermione you go there instead that castle what about you im going be knight said ron chessmen seemed have been listening because at these words knight bishop castle turned their backs on white pieces walked off board leaving three empty squares that ron hermione took white always plays first chess said ron peering across board yes  look  white pawn had moved forward two squares ron started direct black pieces they moved silently wherever sent them harrys knees were trembling what if they lost  move diagonally four squares right their first real shock came when their other knight taken white queen smashed him floor dragged him off board where lay quite still facedown had let that happen said ron looking shaken leaves you free take that bishop hermione go on every time one their men lost white pieces showed no mercy soon there huddle limp black players slumped along wall twice ron only just noticed time that hermione were danger himself darted around board taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones were nearly there muttered suddenly let me think  let me think  white queen turned her blank face toward him yes  said ron softly its only way  ive got be taken no hermione shouted thats chess snapped ron youve got make some sacrifices i make my move shell take me  that leaves you free checkmate king but   do you want stop snape or not ron   look if you dont hurry up hell already have stone there no alternative ready ron called his face pale but determined here i go  now dont hang around once youve won stepped forward white queen pounced she struck ron hard across head with her stone arm crashed floor  hermione screamed but stayed on her square  white queen dragged ron one side looked as if hed been knocked out shaking moved three spaces left white king took off his crown threw at harrys feet they had won chessmen parted bowed leaving door ahead clear with one last desperate look back at ron hermione charged through door up next passageway what if hes   hell be all right said trying convince himself what do you reckons next weve had sprouts that devils snare flitwick mustve put charms on keys mcgonagall transfigured chessmen make them alive that leaves quirrells spell snapes  they had reached another door all right whispered go on pushed open disgusting smell filled their nostrils making both them pull their robes up over their noses eyes watering they saw flat on floor front them troll even larger than one they had tackled out cold with bloody lump on its head im glad we didnt have fight that one whispered as they stepped carefully over one its massive legs come on i cant breathe pulled open next door both them hardly daring look at what came next  but there nothing very frightening here just table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on line snapes said what do we have do they stepped over threshold immediately fire sprang up behind them doorway wasnt ordinary fire either purple at same instant black flames shot up doorway leading onward they were trapped look hermione seized roll paper lying next bottles looked over her shoulder read danger lies before you while safety lies behind two us will help you whichever you would find one among us seven will let you move ahead another will transport drinker back instead two among our number hold only nettle wine three us are killers waiting hidden line choose unless you wish stay here forevermore help you your choice we give you these clues four first however slyly poison tries

different size neither dwarf nor giant holds death their insides fourth second left second on right are twins once you taste them though different at first sight hermione let out great sigh amazed saw that she smiling very last thing felt like doing brilliant said hermione this isnt magic  its logic  puzzle lot greatest wizards havent got an ounce logic theyd be stuck here forever but so will we wont we course not said hermione everything we need is here on this paper seven bottles three are poison two are wine one will get us safely through black fire one will get us back through purple but how do we know which drink give me minute hermione read paper several times then she walked up down line bottles muttering herself pointing at them at last she clapped her hands got she said smallest bottle will get us through black fire  toward stone looked at tiny bottle theres only enough there for one us said thats hardly one swallow they looked at each other which one will get you back through purple flames hermione pointed at rounded bottle at right end line you drink that said no listen get back get ron grab brooms from flying key room theyll get you out trapdoor past fluffy  go straight owlery send hedwig dumbledore we need him i might be able hold snape off for while but im no match for him really but  what if you know  whos with him well  i lucky once wasnt i said pointing at his scar i might get lucky again hermiones lip trembled she suddenly dashed at threw her arms around him hermionel  youre great wizard you know im not as good as you said very embarrassed as she let go him me said hermione books cleverness there are more important things  friendship bravery  oh  be carefull you drink first said you are sure which is which arent you positive said hermione she took long drink from round bottle at end shuddered its not poison said anxiously no  but its like ice quick go before wears off good luck  take care   go hermione turned walked straight through purple fire took deep breath picked up smallest bottle turned face black flames here i come said drained little bottle one gulp indeed as though ice flooding his body put bottle down walked forward braced himself saw black flames licking his body but couldnt feel them  for moment could see nothing but dark fire  then on other side last chamber there already someone there  but wasnt snape wasnt even voldemort man with two faces quirrell you gasped quirrell smiled his face wasnt twitching at all me said calmly i wondered whether id be meeting you here potter but i thought  snape   severus quirrell laughed wasnt his usual quivering treble either but cold sharp yes severus does seem type doesnt so useful have him swooping around like an overgrown bat next him who would suspect p p poor st  stuttering p professor quirrell couldnt take this couldnt be true couldnt but snape tried kill me no no no  tried kill you your friend miss granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed set fire snape at that quidditch match she broke my eye contact with you another few seconds id have got you off that broom id have managed before then if snape hadnt been muttering countercurse trying save you snape trying save me course said quirrell coolly why do you think wanted referee your next match trying make sure i didnt do again funny really  neednt have bothered i couldnt do anything with dumbledore watching all other teachers thought snape trying stop gryffindor from winning did make himself unpopular    what waste time when after all that im going kill you tonight quirrell snapped his fingers ropes sprang out thin air wrapped themselves tightly around youre too nosy live potter scurrying around school on halloween like that for all i knew youd seen me coming look at what guarding stone  you let troll certainly i have special gift with trolls  you must have seen what i did one chamber back there unfortunately while everyone else running around looking for snape who already suspected me went straight third floor head me off  not only did my troll fail beat you death that three headed dog didnt even manage bite snape s leg off properly now wait quietly potter i need examine this interesting mirror only then that realized what standing behind quirrell mirror erised this mirror is key finding stone quirrell murmured tapping his way around frame trust dumbledore come up with something like this    but hes london  ill be far away by time gets back  all could think doing keep quirrell talking stop him from concentrating on mirror i saw you snape forest   blurted out yes said quirrell idly walking around mirror look at back on me by that time trying find out how far id got suspected me all along tried frighten me  as though could when i had lord voldemort on my side  quirrell came back out from behind mirror stared hungrily into i see stone  im presenting my master  but where is struggled against ropes binding him but they didnt give had keep quirrell from giving his whole attention mirror but snape always seemed hate me so much oh does said quirrell casually heavens yes at hogwarts with your father didnt you know they loathed each other but never wanted you dead but i heard you few days ago sobbing  i thought snape threatening you for first time spasm fear flitted across quirrells face sometimes said i find hard follow my masters instructions  is great wizard i am weak   you mean there classroom with you gasped is with me wherever i go said quirrell quietly i met him when i traveled around world foolish young man i then full ridiculous ideas about good evil lord voldemort showed me how wrong i there is no good evil there is only power those too weak seek  since then i have served him faithfully although i have let him down many times has had be very hard on me quirrell shivered suddenly does not forgive mistakes easily when i failed steal stone from gringotts most displeased punished me    decided would have keep closer watch on me  quirrells voice trailed away remembering his trip diagon alley  how could have been so stupid hed seen quirrell there that very day shaken hands with him leaky cauldron quirrell cursed under his breath i dont understand  is stone inside mirror should i break harrys mind racing what i want more than anything else world at moment thought is find stone before quirrell does so if i look mirror i should see my self finding  which means ill see where its hidden but how can i look without quirrell realizing what im up tried edge left get front glass without quirrell noticing but ropes around his ankles were too tight tripped fell over quirrell ignored him still talking himself what does this mirror do how does work help me master harrys horror voice answered voice seemed come from quirrell himself use boy  use boy  quirrell rounded on yes  potter  come here clapped his hands once ropes binding fell off got slowly his feet come here quirrell repeated look mirror tell me what you see walked toward him i must lie thought desperately i must look lie about what i see thats all quirrell moved close behind him breathed funny smell that seemed come from quirrells turban closed his eyes stepped front mirror opened them again saw his reflection pale scared looking at first but moment later reflection smiled at him put its hand into its pocket pulled out blood  red stone winked put stone back its pocket  as did so felt something heavy drop into his real pocket somehow  incredibly  hed gotten stone well said quirrell impatiently what do you see screwed up his courage i see myself shaking hands with dumbledore invented i  ive won house cup for gryffindor quirrell cursed again get out way said as moved aside felt sorcerers stone against his leg dare make break for but hadnt walked five paces before high voice spoke though quirrell wasnt moving his lips lies  lies  potter come back here quirrell shouted tell me truth what did you just see high voice spoke again let me speak him  face face  master you are not strong enough i have strength enough  for this  felt as if devils snare rooting him spot couldnt move muscle petrified watched as quirrell reached up began unwrap his turban what going on turban fell away quirrells head looked strangely small without then turned slowly on spot would have screamed but couldnt make sound where there should have been back quirrells head there face most terrible face had ever seen chalk white with glaring red eyes slits for nostrils like snake potter  whispered tried take step backward but his legs wouldnt move see what i have become face said mere shadow vapor  i have form only when i can share anothers body    but there have always been those willing let me into their hearts minds  unicorn blood has strengthened me these past weeks    you saw faithful quirrell drinking for me forest  once i have elixir life i will be able create body my own  now  why dont you give me that stone your pocket so knew feeling suddenly surged back into harrys legs stumbled backward dont be fool snarled face better save your own life join me  or youll meet same end as your parents  they died begging me for mercy  liar shouted suddenly quirrell walking backward at him so that voldemort could still see him evil face now smiling how touching  hissed i always value bravery  yes boy your parents were brave  i killed your father first put up courageous fight    but your mother neednt have died  she trying protect you  now give me stone unless you want her have died vain never sprang toward flame door but voldemort screamed seize him next second felt quirrells hand close on his wrist at once needle sharp pain seared across harrys scar his head felt as though about split two yelled struggling with all his might his surprise quirrell let go him pain his head lessened  looked around wildly see where quirrell had gone saw him hunched pain looking at his fingers  they were blistering before his eyes seize him seize him shrieked voldemort again quirrell lunged knocking clean off his feet landing on top him both hands around harrys neck  harrys scar almost blinding him with pain yet could see quirrell howling agony master i cannot hold him  my hands  my hands quirrell though pinning ground with his knees let go his neck stared bewildered at his own palms  could see they looked burned raw red shiny then kill him fool be done screeched voldemort quirrell raised his hand perform deadly curse but by instinct reached up grabbed quirrells face  aaaargh quirrell rolled off him his face blistering too then knew quirrell couldnt touch his bare skin not without suffering terrible pain  his only chance keep hold quirrell keep him enough pain stop him from doing curse jumped his feet caught quirrell by arm hung on as tight as could quirrell screamed tried throw off  pain harrys head building  couldnt see  could only hear quirrells terrible shrieks voldemorts yells kill him kill him other voices maybe harrys own head crying harry felt quirrells arm wrenched from his grasp knew all lost fell into blackness down  down  down  something gold glinting just above him snitch tried catch but his arms were too heavy blinked wasnt snitch at all pair glasses how strange blinked again smiling face albus dumbledore swam into view above him good afternoon said dumbledore stared at him then remembered sir stone quirrell hes got stone sir quick  calm yourself dear boy you are little behind times said dumbledore quirrell does not have stone then who does sir i   please relax or madam pomfrey will have me thrown out swallowed looked around him realized must be hospital wing lying bed with white linen sheets next him table piled high with what looked like half candy shop tokens from your friends admirers said dumbledore beaming what happened down dungeons between you professor quirrell is complete secret so naturally whole school knows i believe your friends misters fred george weasley were responsible for trying send you toilet seat no doubt they thought would amuse you madam pomfrey however felt might not be very hygienic confiscated how long have i been here three days mr ronald weasley miss granger will be most relieved you have come round they have been extremely worried but sir stone   i see you are not be distracted very well stone professor quirrell did not manage take from you i arrived time prevent that although you were doing very well on your own i must say you got there you got hermiones owl we must have crossed midair no sooner had i reached london than became clear me that place i should be one i had just left i arrived just time pull quirrell off you   you i feared i might be too late you nearly were i couldnt have kept him off stone much longer   not stone boy you  effort involved nearly killed you for one terrible moment there i afraid had as for stone has been destroyed destroyed said blankly but your friend  nicolas flamel   oh you know about nicolas said dumbledore sounding quite delighted you did do thing properly didnt you well nicolas i have had little chat agreed its all for best but that means his wife will die wont they they have enough elixir stored set their affairs order then yes they will die dumbledore smiled at look amazement on harrys face one as young as you im sure seems incredible but nicolas perenelle really is like going bed after very very long day after all well  organized mind death is but next great adventure you know stone really not such wonderful thing as much money life as you could want two things most human beings would choose above all  trouble is humans do have knack choosing precisely those things that are worst for them lay there lost for words dumbledore hummed little smiled at ceiling sir said ive been thinking  sir  even if stones gone vol  i mean you know who   call him voldemort always use proper name for things fear name increases fear thing itself yes sir well voldemorts going try other ways coming back isnt i mean hasnt gone has no has not is still out there somewhere perhaps looking for another body share  not being truly alive cannot be killed left quirrell die shows just as little mercy his followers as his enemies nevertheless while you may only have delayed his return power will merely take someone else who is prepared fight what seems losing battle next time  if is delayed again again why may never return power nodded but stopped quickly because made his head hurt then said sir there are some other things id like know if you can tell me  things i want know truth about  truth dumbledore sighed is beautiful terrible thing should therefore be treated with great caution however i shall answer your questions unless i have very good reason not which case i beg you  forgive me i shall not course lie well  voldemort said that only killed my mother because she tried stop him from killing me but why would want kill me first place dumbledore sighed very deeply this time alas first thing you ask me i cannot tell you not today not now you will know one day  put from your mind for now when you are older    i know you hate hear this    when you are ready you will know knew would be no good argue but why couldnt quirrell touch me your mother died save you if there is one thing voldemort cannot understand is love didnt realize that love as powerful as your mothers for you leaves its own mark not scar no visible sign  have been loved so deeply even though person who loved us is gone will give us some protection forever is your very skin quirrell full hatred greed ambition sharing his soul with voldemort could not touch you for this reason agony touch person marked by something so good dumbledore now became very interested bird out on windowsill which gave time dry his eyes on sheet when had found his voice again said invisibility cloak  do you know who sent me ah  your father happened leave my possession i thought you might like dumbledores eyes twinkled useful things  your father used mainly for sneaking off kitchens steal food when here theres something else  fire away quirrell said snape   professor snape yes him  quirrell said hates me because hated my father is that true well they did rather detest each other not unlike yourself mr malfoy then your father did something snape could never forgive what saved his life what yes  said dumbledore dreamily funny way peoples minds work isnt professor snape couldnt bear being your fathers debt  i do believe worked so hard protect you this year because felt that would make him your father even then could go back hating your fathers memory peace  tried understand this but made his head pound so stopped sir theres one more thing  just one how did i get stone out mirror ah now im glad you asked me that one my more brilliant ideas between you me thats saying something you see only one who wanted find stone  find but not use  would be able get otherwise theyd just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir life my brain surprises even me sometimes  now enough questions i suggest you make start on these sweets ah bertie botts every flavor beans i unfortunate enough my youth come across vomit flavored one since then im afraid ive rather lost my liking for them  but i think ill be safe with nice toffee dont you smiled popped golden brown bean into his mouth then choked said alas ear wax madam pomfrey nurse nice woman but very strict just five minutes pleaded absolutely not you let professor dumbledore  well course that headmaster quite different you need rest i am resting look lying down everything oh go on madam pomfrey  oh very well she said but five minutes only she let ron hermione harryl hermione looked ready fling her arms around him again but glad she held herself as his head still very sore oh we were sure you were going  dumbledore so worried   whole schools talking about said ron what really happened one those rare occasions when true story is even more strange exciting than wild rumors told them everything quirrell mirror stone voldemort ron hermione were very good audience they gasped all right places when told them what under quirrells turban hermione screamed out loud so stones gone said ron finally flamels just going die thats what i said but dumbledore thinks that  what  well organized mind death is but next great adventure  i always said off his rocker said ron looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero so what happened you two said well i got back all right said hermione i brought ron round  that took while  we were dashing up owlery contact dumbledore when we met him entrance hall  already knew  just said harrys gone after him hasnt hurtled off third floor dyou think meant you do said ron sending you your fathers cloak everything well hermione exploded if did  i mean say  thats terrible  you could have been killed no isnt said thoughtfully hes funny man dumbledore i think sort wanted give me chance i think knows more or less everything that goes on here you know i reckon had pretty good idea we were going try instead stopping us just taught us enough help i dont think an accident let me find out how mirror worked its almost like thought i had right face voldemort if i could  yeah dumbledores off his rocker all right said ron proudly listen youve

understood made his way down end year feast alone that night had been held up by madam pomfreys fussing about insisting on giving him one last checkup so great hall already full decked out slytherin colors green silver celebrate slytherin s winning house cup for seventh year row huge banner showing slytherin serpent covered wall behind high table when walked there sudden hush then everybody started talking loudly at once slipped into seat between ron hermione at gryffindor table tried ignore fact that people were standing up look at him fortunately dumbledore arrived moments later babble died away another year gone dumbledore said cheerfully i must trouble you with an old mans wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast what year has been hopefully your heads are all little fuller than they were    you have whole summer ahead get them nice empty before next year starts  now as i understand house cup here needs awarding points stand thus fourth place gryffindor with three hundred twelve points third hufflepuff with three hundred fifty two ravenclaw has four hundred twenty six slytherin four hundred seventy  two storm cheering stamping broke out from slytherin table could see draco malfoy banging his goblet on table sickening sight yes yes well done slytherin said dumbledore however recent events must be taken into account room went very still slytherins smiles faded little ahem said dumbledore i have few last minute points dish out let me see yes  first  mr ronald weasley  ron went purple face looked like radish with bad sunburn  for best played game chess hogwarts has seen many years i award gryffindor house fifty points gryffindor cheers nearly raised bewitched ceiling stars overhead seemed quiver percy could be heard telling other prefects my brother you know my youngest brother got past mcgonagalls giant chess set at last there silence again second  miss hermione granger    for use cool logic face fire i award gryffindor house fifty points hermione buried her face her arms strongly suspected she had burst into tears gryffindors up down table were beside themselves  they were hundred points up third  mr potter  said dumbledore room went deadly quiet  for pure nerve outstanding courage i award gryffindor house sixty points din deafening those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that gryffindor now had four hundred seventy two points  exactly same as slytherin they had tied for house cup  if only dumbledore had given just one more point dumbledore raised his hand room gradually fell silent there are all kinds courage said dumbledore smiling takes great deal bravery stand up our enemies but just as much stand up our friends i therefore award ten points mr neville longbottom someone standing outside great hall might well have thought some sort explosion had taken place so loud noise that erupted from gryffindor table ron hermione stood up yell cheer as neville white with shock disappeared under pile people hugging him had never won so much as point for gryffindor before still cheering nudged ron ribs pointed at malfoy who couldnt have looked more stunned horrified if hed just had body bind curse put on him which means dumbledore called over storm applause for even ravenclaw hufflepuff were celebrating downfall slytherin we need little change decoration clapped his hands an instant green hangings became scarlet silver became gold huge slytherin serpent vanished towering gryffindor lion took its place snape shaking professor mcgonagalls hand with horrible forced smile caught harrys eye knew at once that snape s feelings toward him hadnt changed one jot this didnt worry seemed as though life would be back normal next year or as normal as ever at hogwarts best evening harrys life better than winning at quidditch or christmas or knocking out mountain trolls  would never ever forget tonight had almost forgotten that exam results were still come but come they did their great surprise both ron passed with good marks hermione course had best grades first years even neville scraped through his good herbology mark making up for his abysmal potions one they had hoped that goyle who almost as stupid as mean might be thrown out but had passed too shame but as ron said you couldnt have everything life suddenly their wardrobes were empty their trunks were packed nevilles toad found lurking corner toilets notes were handed out all students warning them not use magic over holidays i always hope theyll forget give us these said fred weasley sadly hagrid there take them down fleet boats that sailed across lake they were boarding hogwarts express talking laughing as countryside became greener tidier eating bertie botts every flavor beans as they sped past muggle towns pulling off their wizard robes putting on jackets coats pulling into platform nine three quarters at kings cross station took quite while for them all get off platform wizened old guard up by ticket barrier letting them go through gate twos threes so they didnt attract attention by all bursting out solid wall at once alarming muggles you must come stay this summer said ron both you
