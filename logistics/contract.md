# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet at least once a week. We will determine which day to meet every Sunday, and will meet for at least an hour. During these meetings, we will collaborate on creating a brainstorming/logistical document, along with assignment delegation. Every other meeting will be a "code sprint meeting", where we will all code together during our alloted timeslot. Each member will rotate writing the development log, starting with jsneh2. 

2. **Assistance** We have set up a discord and text chat. We can also email if it's convenient. Outside of emergencies or other commitments. For actionable items, we must respond within 24 hours of the initial text.

3. **Respect** No one will be assigned as project manager, we expect to be able to delegate work democratically. If we run into issues, we may choose to elect a PM or talk to our mentor. Major decisions about the project's direction and implementation must be unanimously agreed upon (i.e. changing to a different algorithm, code style, distribution of tasks) but small changes are up to the whim of the individual developer as the issues arise. 

## Collaboration

1. **Work Distribution** Every week, we will either divvy up tasks based on preferences and the amount of time that each person can commit during that week. If there are tasks left, then they will be randomly assigned, or pushed back to a later point if they are not detrimental to the project's progress. Obviously, this weekly plan can be adjusted and is flexible, but the intention is to have a reasonable estimation of work each week.

2. **Time Commitment** We pledge to commit at least an hour each a week. The average amount of time put in should generally be higher, but as we are busy and do not want to make heavy weeks even heavier, 1 hour is the minimum, with an expectation of 2. If someone wants to contribute more, that is their choice, but if someone is consistently contributing 4 hours, while everyone else contributes 1, we will have a team meeting and talk with our mentor.


3. **Conflict Resolution** All conflicts within the team will be talked over a civil ISR dinner. If we cannot resolve the issue after an hour of talking and attempting to compromise, then we will approach staff.
